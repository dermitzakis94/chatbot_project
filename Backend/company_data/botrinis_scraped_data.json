In Tuscany, which, along with Corfu, is one of the two homelands of Ettore Botrini, Pegasus symbolized the passage from darkness and chaos to the freedom of spirit.

It is defined by austerity of expressive means and is passed on from generation to generation through the unconscious channels of imitation and habit.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n         “Scholarly”, cosmopolitan cuisine evolves in societies of great economic prosperity. It is characterized by creativity and originality resulting from the ceaseless exploration of gastronomic pleasures. It progresses through the work of professional chefs. It constantly explores new ingredients, and it borrows or invents techniques.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n         During Ettore Botrini’s childhood, the workers of Corfu smoked herring, a ‘fish of the mountain’, in newspapers in order to preserve it for a long time. They enjoyed it with other humble ingredients such as cornbread and wild greens they found in the countryside. This dish is an embodiment of the above-mentioned theory: an application of the coupling of rural and “scholarly” cuisine.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n         Deipnosophistis, Deipnosophistis, 1991\n        </p>\n       </div>\n      </section>\n      <div>\n       <picture>\n        <source>\n         <img alt=\"Botrinis Restaurant-\" src=\"https://botrinis.com/wp-content/uploads/philosophy_fish_botrinis_restaurant.jpg\"/>\n        </source>\n       </picture>\n      </div>\n     </div>\n    </article>\n   </section>\n   <section>\n    <div>\n     <div>\n      <picture>\n       <source>\n        <img alt=\"Botrinis Restaurant-Ethos\" src=\"https://botrinis.com/wp-content/uploads/philosophy-chef-botrini-restaurant.jpg\"/>\n       </source>\n      </picture>\n     </div>\n    </div>\n    <article>\n     <div>\n      <h2>\n       Ethos\n      </h2>\n      <div>\n       <p>\n        We are committed to sustainable practices.

Our chef, transforming his memories into flavors, textures and aromas. He creates sensory landscapes.\nHis menus draw inspiration from his family tradition, from the history of the places where he grew up, lived or traveled and he tells the stories of these places, and from the world of visual arts and literature. His goal is for you to experience the meal at Botrini’s as a gastronomic experience, like a journey into a world of aromas and flavors.\nOur Emblem\nOur emblem is Pegasus, a pure white, winged horse, a unique mythical being, starring in one of the longest-standing myths of Western civilization. In Tuscany, which, along with Corfu, is one of the two homelands of Ettore Botrini, Pegasus symbolized the passage from darkness and chaos to the freedom of spirit. Under this emblem’s aegis are nestled three archetypal symbols, that represent Mother Nature’s abundance, and the Mediterranean diet: Wheat, olive oil, wine.\nHerring, A Journey\nThrough Time\nAccording to “Deipnosophistis”, an important figure of Greek gastronomic literature, every cuisine has two sources: a rural and a “scholarly”.\nRural, folk cuisine is domestic, agricultural, and inextricably linked to its land. It is defined by austerity of expressive means and is passed on from generation to generation through the unconscious channels of imitation and habit.\n“Scholarly”, cosmopolitan cuisine evolves in societies of great economic prosperity. It is characterized by creativity and originality resulting from the ceaseless exploration of gastronomic pleasures. It progresses through the work of professional chefs. It constantly explores new ingredients, and it borrows or invents techniques.\nDuring Ettore Botrini’s childhood, the workers of Corfu smoked herring, a ‘fish of the mountain’, in newspapers in order to preserve it for a long time. They enjoyed it with other humble ingredients such as cornbread and wild greens they found in the countryside. This dish is an embodiment of the above-mentioned theory: an application of the coupling of rural and “scholarly” cuisine.\nDeipnosophistis, Deipnosophistis, 1991\nEthos\nWe are committed to sustainable practices. We honor the Greek terroir. We invariably source our seasonal, high-quality ingredients from small local producers, whose devotion inspire our gastronomy. We employ techniques that allow us to use every peel or bread crumb. We create pickles, garum and stocks out of matter often considered waste. We refrain from using plastic and we recycle. We inform our guests about the importance of those causes through our stories.\nOur Peaches from Last Summer\nThe act of eating is our deepest connection with nature, with the non-human world. During this critical period, the public debate on culinary sustainability has escalated encouragingly. More than ever, we seek seasonality and locality. We talk about sustainable development, our footprint, and culinary ethics.\nFor us, the basic principle is simple: We ought to cultivate, cook, eat, and function in a way that is in harmony with the earth. One of the applications of this doctrine is “zero waste”: the full utilization of ingredients.\nFor our pre-dessert, we have chosen the renowned peaches of the plains of Imathia, in Northern Greece.

He was inspired to become a Chef by his father’s love for cooking. He studied Tourism Management at the Ecole Hôtelière de Lausanne. He had the chance to gain culinary experience in 3 Michelin star-rated restaurants in France and Spain and work side by side with some world-class Chefs including his current friend, Martin Berasategui.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n       He is involved in a series of renowned gastronomic projects, and he is the Chef-Patron of two restaurants: Botrini’s, and Etrusco restaurant in Corfu, named after his father, one of the most historic restaurants in Greece.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n       According to Fnl Guide 2020, Ettore Botrini’s main contribution to Greek gastronomy is that he has been charged -by the most important culinary critics and institutions- with paving the way for the evolution of Greek cuisine as “in addition to being the best chef in the country… he is the man who ‘taught’ modern techniques to Greek customers and chefs.”\n      </p>\n      <p>\n       He is one of the most recognizable personalities of the Greek culinary scene as he has starred in a series of TV shows including the Greek version of “Kitchen Nightmare”.

He left Athens, where he grew up, at the age of 26 to take on roles at some of the most important restaurants in the world. He worked in the kitchens of Fat Duck (3 Michelin stars, 1 time World’s Best Restaurant – 50 Best, England), Quintonil (2 Michelin stars, Mexico), Noma (3 Michelin stars, 4 times World’s Best Restaurant – 50 Best, Denmark), Alchemist (2 Michelin stars) and found his home for 5 years at Hiša Franko, which he assisted as a sous chef, be awarded first with 2 and then with 3 Michelin stars (2023) and with the Michelin green star.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n       At Hiša Franko he learned to cook with ingredients that each place offers (in this case the mountains of northwestern Slovenia) and made locality and sustainability the main principles of his culinary approach. His aesthetic in cooking is minimalist and is inspired by the creativity of Ferran Adrià and the love of exploration of René Redzepi. He loves seafood, tomatoes and wild herbs that he collects himself with his teams. Since 2025 he has been working as Executive Research &amp; Development Chef at Botrini’s.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n       <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://botrinis.com/wp-content/uploads/our_team_milk_botrinis_restaurant-2.jpg\"/>\n      </p>\n     </div>\n    </article>\n   </section>\n   <section>\n    <div>\n     <div>\n      <picture>\n       <source>\n        <img alt=\"Botrinis Restaurant-Thanos Nasiakos\" src=\"https://botrinis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/restaurant-manager-botrinis.jpg\"/>\n       </source>\n      </picture>\n     </div>\n    </div>\n    <article>\n     <div>\n      <h2>\n       Thanos Nasiakos\n      </h2>\n      <h3>\n       Restaurant Manager\n      </h3>\n      <div>\n       <p>\n        Τhanos, our restaurant manager, has over 10 years of experience in the hospitality and restaurant industry, having worked in various Michelin star restaurants both in Greece and abroad.

He was inspired to become a Chef by his father’s love for cooking. He studied Tourism Management at the Ecole Hôtelière de Lausanne. He had the chance to gain culinary experience in 3 Michelin star-rated restaurants in France and Spain and work side by side with some world-class Chefs including his current friend, Martin Berasategui.\nHe is involved in a series of renowned gastronomic projects, and he is the Chef-Patron of two restaurants: Botrini’s, and Etrusco restaurant in Corfu, named after his father, one of the most historic restaurants in Greece.\nAccording to Fnl Guide 2020, Ettore Botrini’s main contribution to Greek gastronomy is that he has been charged -by the most important culinary critics and institutions- with paving the way for the evolution of Greek cuisine as “in addition to being the best chef in the country… he is the man who ‘taught’ modern techniques to Greek customers and chefs.”\nHe is one of the most recognizable personalities of the Greek culinary scene as he has starred in a series of TV shows including the Greek version of “Kitchen Nightmare”. He speaks five languages fluently (Greek, Italian, Spanish, French & English).\nIlias Ntoukas\nExecutive R&D Chef\nIlias Doukas entered a kitchen by chance at the age of 21 and immediately decided to abandon his studies in a different field to devote himself to cooking. He left Athens, where he grew up, at the age of 26 to take on roles at some of the most important restaurants in the world. He worked in the kitchens of Fat Duck (3 Michelin stars, 1 time World’s Best Restaurant – 50 Best, England), Quintonil (2 Michelin stars, Mexico), Noma (3 Michelin stars, 4 times World’s Best Restaurant – 50 Best, Denmark), Alchemist (2 Michelin stars) and found his home for 5 years at Hiša Franko, which he assisted as a sous chef, be awarded first with 2 and then with 3 Michelin stars (2023) and with the Michelin green star.\nAt Hiša Franko he learned to cook with ingredients that each place offers (in this case the mountains of northwestern Slovenia) and made locality and sustainability the main principles of his culinary approach. His aesthetic in cooking is minimalist and is inspired by the creativity of Ferran Adrià and the love of exploration of René Redzepi. He loves seafood, tomatoes and wild herbs that he collects himself with his teams. Since 2025 he has been working as Executive Research & Development Chef at Botrini’s.\nThanos Nasiakos\nRestaurant Manager\nΤhanos, our restaurant manager, has over 10 years of experience in the hospitality and restaurant industry, having worked in various Michelin star restaurants both in Greece and abroad.
