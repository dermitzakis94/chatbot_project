conferience.com at our first conference and we got enthusiastic reviews by the event delegates. Conferience.com has a new style in the way the participants interact with the speakers of our conferences. They ask questions through the web-app, anonymously or not, the most popular questions appear to everybody and the conversation gets a new approach and becomes more interesting! Even foreign speakers have given very positive reviews about the interesting questions that are uploaded during their presentations. The agenda is always updated with full details of the panels and the speakers. In the future, all other features of the platform, such as speaker evaluation or the raffle and participation option, are going to add value to the conferences of Boussias Communications.\n           </p>\n          </div>\n         </div>\n         <div>\n          <div>\n           <div>\n            <div>\n             <img alt=\"\" src=\"/web/images/testimonials/clarke.jpg\"/>\n            </div>\n            <div>\n             <h5>\n              Steve Clarke\n             </h5>\n             <p>\n              -\n              <b>\n               Sales Mentor, Author,\n              </b>\n              ,\n              <b>\n               Inspirational Business Speaker\n              </b>\n             </p>\n            </div>\n            <div>\n            </div>\n           </div>\n           <p>\n            I am very impressed by the web-app \"Conferience\" a great way to interact with an audience.

Helped tremendously in preparation of the content and the questions, but more important was the high increase of the interaction with participants surpassing the 90%. Needless to mention that an overall assessment of the summit was “excellent”. Since then, I use “Conferience” to any seminar, conference, summit, and workshop. For me is a valuable tool that helps me both in organization and in effective coordination and communication with participants. Important is the continuous support provided to the product, in order to adapt specific needs, frequently upgraded with new features. I strongly recommend “Conferience”, adds value and makes the difference!\n           </p>\n          </div>\n         </div>\n         <div>\n          <div>\n           <div>\n            <div>\n             <img alt=\"\" src=\"/web/images/testimonials/michaelidis.jpg\"/>\n            </div>\n            <div>\n             <h5>\n              Angelina Michaelidis\n             </h5>\n             <p>\n              -\n              <b>\n               General Manager\n              </b>\n              ,\n              <b>\n               Response International S.A.\n              </b>\n             </p>\n            </div>\n            <div>\n            </div>\n           </div>\n           <p>\n            Conferience is an interactive tool that adds value to the time I devote for business conferences.

However, what really makes it stand out, is how\naccurately it responds to our needs. In a world where computer science and technology are advancing and\nevolving at great speed, Conferience gives us the opportunity to welcome our audience to a “new\ndimension”, where attending a conference has ceased to be a “passive” process, as the participants are\nenabled to ask questions and to evaluate the speeches as well as the conference as a whole in real time.\nThis is a tool which has given a unique “note” to our conferences.

Apart from the incredible ability and the real time communication, the platform gives the possibility to the organizer of the event to easily create an event on his/her own. My personal experience with this platform at the event organization, as well at its use, is one of the most ideal of an IT tool; it concentrates on the event itself, on the interaction and the comments of the attendees, and not on technical complexity. In just one word, it is \"effective\".\n           </p>\n          </div>\n         </div>\n         <div>\n          <div>\n           <div>\n            <div>\n             <img alt=\"\" src=\"/web/images/testimonials/eso.jpg\"/>\n            </div>\n            <div>\n             <h5>\n              Vassilios P.

It is very easy to use, both for the administrator and for the participants. During our workshop, it encouraged the participation of the audience both by giving them the opportunity to enter questions and to vote for the ones that they found most interesting. At the same time, it enabled us (the organizers) to capture all questions, manage them according to their relevance to the Workshop's topic and prioritize them, based on likes, thus, manage efficiently the timing of the Q&amp;A session. Additionally, the ex post full question report we received was very useful. In our next conferences, we intend to make use of Conferience’s Event Evaluation feature, in order to get constructive feedback avoiding printed evaluation forms.\n           </p>\n          </div>\n         </div>\n         <div>\n          <div>\n           <div>\n            <div>\n             <img alt=\"\" src=\"/web/images/testimonials/milias.jpg\"/>\n            </div>\n            <div>\n             <h5>\n              Panos Milias\n             </h5>\n             <p>\n              -\n              <b>\n               Digital Media Manager\n              </b>\n              ,\n              <b>\n               Nestle Hellas SA\n              </b>\n             </p>\n            </div>\n            <div>\n            </div>\n           </div>\n           <p>\n            Conferience was a great experience in our event. It was very well-received that managed to engage and\nmotivate our audience to make questions. I would definitely suggest it in internal events, as many\ncolleagues do not have the courage to make a question orally. Additionally, the audience has the\nopportunity to check what is being asked, vote in case someone has the same question and think what else\ncould be asked. Then, the dialogue begins!!!\n           </p>\n          </div>\n         </div>\n         <div>\n          <div>\n           <div>\n            <div>\n             <img alt=\"\" src=\"/web/images/testimonials/kyriopoulos.jpg\"/>\n            </div>\n            <div>\n             <h5>\n              John Kyriopoulos\n             </h5>\n             <p>\n              -\n              <b>\n               Professor Emeritus of Health Economics\n              </b>\n              ,\n              <b>\n               National School of Public Health\n              </b>\n             </p>\n            </div>\n            <div>\n            </div>\n           </div>\n           <p>\n            The \"Conferience\" was used at the 13th Healthworld Conference for televoting needs among several participants.

Since the idea of innovation is\ninextricably linked with Frezyderm, I am constantly searching for programs, techniques and ideas that\nwill contribute to improving the organization and achieving a better function and training of the sales\ndepartment. Choosing Conferience in order to train the sales department proved to be excellent. It justly\nmet the demands I had set. The training of a department that consists of many people is demanding and\nusually difficult, which means that we have to overcome any difficulties by finding the adequate tools or\nsuccessful ways to do so. Conferience passed the test! Except for the fact that it impressed the\nparticipants, it managed to improve the training as far as time, participation, results and conclusions are\nconcerned. The ability it provided when carrying out statistical results in reference to the training, as well\nas individual performance of the participants, gave us feedback to use during the next training cycle. The\nuse of back office was easy after the support and help I had from the Conferience team. The support was\nexcellent and ready to provide solutions. I will definitely use Conferience again in the next training cycle or\nconference!\n           </p>\n          </div>\n         </div>\n         <div>\n          <div>\n           <div>\n            <div>\n             <img alt=\"\" src=\"/web/images/testimonials/pafili.jpg\"/>\n            </div>\n            <div>\n             <h5>\n              Agathi Pafili\n             </h5>\n             <p>\n              -\n              <b>\n               Senior Regulatory Policy Advisor\n              </b>\n              ,\n              <b>\n               European Fund and Asset Management Association (EFAMA)\n              </b>\n             </p>\n            </div>\n            <div>\n            </div>\n           </div>\n           <p>\n            Conferience is a great tool that allows a true interaction between speakers and audience in a fast, easy and efficient way.

The pressure to achieve an organization of\nhigh quality was intense. Given the theme of our event, we chose Conferience as an example of a\nsuccessful Startup and we were not disappointed. On the contrary, Conferience confirmed its reputation\nand exceeded our expectations.Its usage was simple and easy, it contributed to the overall experience of\nour audience who were able to conveniently place questions and remarks without the stress of verbal\ncommunication or interrupting the flow of discussion. Through a democratic procedure, the best question\nwas voted to finally be addressed to the speakers, promoting the conversation. Conferience team was\n100% alert and supportive to provide any guidance we needed, and the platform responded excellently\nduring the discussion as well as during the evaluation of the event and the polls in the startup pitching\ncontest. In the end we were able to quickly receive poll results, analytic infographics, as well as exported\ndata and statistics, yielding valuable information about audience engagement and feedback. Conferience\nmajorly enhanced satisfaction and overall success of our event, impressing our audience and providing\nuseful tools to calculate variables of this success. It has been a problem solver. Using Conferience in the\nfuture for similar events, is recommended and for us, it is a given.\n           </p>\n          </div>\n         </div>\n         <div>\n          <div>\n           <div>\n            <div>\n             <img alt=\"\" src=\"/web/images/testimonials/interinnov.png\"/>\n            </div>\n            <div>\n             <h5>\n              Timo Lahnalampi\n             </h5>\n             <p>\n              -\n              <b>\n               Senior Consultant\n              </b>\n              ,\n              <b>\n               Giulia Pastor, Consultant\n              </b>\n             </p>\n            </div>\n            <div>\n            </div>\n           </div>\n           <p>\n            We found the Conferience tool very useful, especially for creating interactivity and asking questions in an event with a very tight timeline.

Knowing that, especially in\nthese big-scale events,\nthere is a gap between the audience and the speakers, we decided to use the features of Conferience to\nbridge it. Having used Conferience last year we found out that all the features were renewed, and the new\ninterface was even more simplified. Apart from that, the questions feature was the highlight of them\nall, impressing all of the speakers along with the audience which was able to make anonymous questions\nwithout any hassle at all. The majority of the audience used it and the results were truly amazing. It gave\nthe event an extraordinary spark setting it apart from others. The questions feature also has the\ndemocratic option of liking questions, so the top ones can be answered first. Inasmuch as this year\nStartup Europe Week Crete 2017 was a chain of events throughout the week the event evaluation feature\nthat is provided through Conferience was certainly very helpful. At the end of the event we could take a\nlook at the responses the audience left and correct some potential mistakes for the next event. The same\nthing could be done with the event report that the Conferience team instantly sent us. The team was\nextremely helpful and responsive and could provide us with any information needed. Using Conferience in\nStartup Europe Week Crete 2017 was undoubtedly very helpful for us and is recommended for similar\nevents.\n           </p>\n          </div>\n         </div>\n         <div>\n          <div>\n           <div>\n            <div>\n             <img alt=\"\" src=\"/web/images/testimonials/PAoT.png\"/>\n            </div>\n            <div>\n             <h5>\n              Fotis Fotopoulos\n             </h5>\n             <p>\n              -\n              <b>\n               President of the Board of the Panhellenic Association of Translators\n              </b>\n              ,\n             </p>\n            </div>\n            <div>\n            </div>\n           </div>\n           <p>\n            Conferience provided us with the necessary tools to boost interaction between the speakers and the audience and meet the fundamental goals of our conference, which were true engagement and communication.\n           </p>\n          </div>\n         </div>\n         <div>\n          <div>\n           <div>\n            <div>\n             <img alt=\"\" src=\"/web/images/testimonials/sofia.png\"/>\n            </div>\n            <div>\n             <h5>\n              Sofia Cruickshank\n             </h5>\n             <p>\n              -\n              <b>\n               Business Administrator\n              </b>\n              ,\n              <b>\n               Next Level Information Ltd\n              </b>\n             </p>\n            </div>\n            <div>\n            </div>\n           </div>\n           <p>\n            Conferience allowed us to move away from a traditional printed event guide and enabled our attendees to\ninteract with speakers anonymously or not, participate in workshops &amp; sessions, vote on polls, view the\nattendees’ list/agenda/speaker profiles/sponsor profiles and receive important announcements. The\nsupport leading up to and throughout the event was extremely responsive and professional, the team\nmade the impossible possible by creating new features within the app to fulfil our needs! Most\nimportantly, we were able to make amendments to any content from the back office seamlessly and our\nattendees found the app very user-friendly.

The conventional medical conference was converted into an interactive, exciting, event due to the app. There was a keen interest in debate sessions and questions from the audience.

It is very easy to use, both for the administrator and for the participants. During our workshop, it encouraged the participation of the audience both by giving them the opportunity to enter questions and to vote for the ones that they found most interesting. At the same time, it enabled us (the organizers) to capture all questions, manage them according to their relevance to the Workshop's topic and prioritize them, based on likes, thus, manage efficiently the timing of the Q&amp;A session. Additionally, the ex post full question report we received was very useful. In our next conferences, we intend to make use of Conferience’s Event Evaluation feature, in order to get constructive feedback avoiding printed evaluation forms.\n           </p>\n          </div>\n         </div>\n         <div>\n          <div>\n           <div>\n            <div>\n             <img alt=\"\" src=\"/web/images/testimonials/KonstantinosKallinteris.jpg\"/>\n            </div>\n            <div>\n             <h5>\n              Konstantinos Kallinteris\n             </h5>\n             <p>\n              -\n              <b>\n               Project Curator of PharmACon (Pharmaceutical Athenian Congress)\n              </b>\n              ,\n             </p>\n            </div>\n            <div>\n            </div>\n           </div>\n           <p>\n            Conferience was the most pioneering application in our congress.

In other words, it was conducive to the improvement of our plan during the event and it enhanced the development of our social network. The support was excellent and ready to provide solutions.

Conferience.com has a new style in the way the participants interact with the speakers of our conferences. They ask questions through the web-app, anonymously or not, the most popular questions appear to everybody and the conversation gets a new approach and becomes more interesting! Even foreign speakers have given very positive reviews about the interesting questions that are uploaded during their presentations. The agenda is always updated with full details of the panels and the speakers. In the future, all other features of the platform, such as speaker evaluation or the raffle and participation option, are going to add value to the conferences of Boussias Communications.\nSteve Clarke\n-\nSales Mentor, Author,\n,\nInspirational Business Speaker\nI am very impressed by the web-app \"Conferience\" a great way to interact with an audience. I will\ndefinitely use this at future conferences\nIakovos Giannaklis\n-\nHead of Branch Network\n,\nEurobank\nConferience provided an innovative and cost-effective solution to attracting questions and ideas from the\nparticipants in a number of internal meetings of our organization. Users were able to easily understand the\nnavigation and functionality of the system and they greatly appreciated the anonymity provided and the\nfact that they could raise questions to issues that were discussed in real time.\nDimitris Georgopoulos\n-\nPartner at Rethink Business Lab.\n,\nBusiness Development Advisor & Executive Coach\nI tested “Conferience”, for the first time at a summit about customer service, where I had the responsibility of coordinating with demanding high-level participants and panels with first class executives. “Conferience” made the difference! Helped tremendously in preparation of the content and the questions, but more important was the high increase of the interaction with participants surpassing the 90%. Needless to mention that an overall assessment of the summit was “excellent”. Since then, I use “Conferience” to any seminar, conference, summit, and workshop. For me is a valuable tool that helps me both in organization and in effective coordination and communication with participants. Important is the continuous support provided to the product, in order to adapt specific needs, frequently upgraded with new features. I strongly recommend “Conferience”, adds value and makes the difference!\nAngelina Michaelidis\n-\nGeneral Manager\n,\nResponse International S.A.\nConferience is an interactive tool that adds value to the time I devote for business conferences. The use of Conferience.com started as an exploration, smoothly, using its fantastic, very handy user-interface. Soon after, I was attracted by the different features, the power I acquire in my hands expressing my view and make my questions shared with the rest of the audience. From now on, I definitely prefer to attend conferences, if Conferience is available.\nKonstantinos Ouzounis\n-\nCEO\n,\nEthos Media S.A.\nConferience has proved an innovative and also smart application, as it allows interaction among the\nspeakers and the participants of our conferences. However, what really makes it stand out, is how\naccurately it responds to our needs. In a world where computer science and technology are advancing and\nevolving at great speed, Conferience gives us the opportunity to welcome our audience to a “new\ndimension”, where attending a conference has ceased to be a “passive” process, as the participants are\nenabled to ask questions and to evaluate the speeches as well as the conference as a whole in real time.\nThis is a tool which has given a unique “note” to our conferences. Thank you for adding value to our\nconferences.\nMichael R. Virardi\n-\nTrainer | Speaker | Author\n,\nConferience was not what I was waiting for to be developed. Conferience was what I needed to be developed!\nAntonis  Kotzamanidis\n-\nManaging Director\n,\nEntersoft S.A.\nWe have used the Conferience service in an internal personnel meeting for the first time this year. It\nactually proved to be a new interactive experience for the participants, both in posing questions and in\nspecific polls which took place during the meeting. It performed beyond our expectations, as it helped to\ncollect essential feedback from participants and made presentations more pleasant. I strongly recommend\nit and we will definitely use it again in future events.\nIsavella Vitou\n-\nGroup Transformation Sector, Group Strategy\n,\nEurobank Ergasias SA\nConferience is an innovative and very user-friendly application. The competitive advantage of\nConferience is that it can be accessed easily and quickly by any smart phone device that is connected to\nthe internet. For this reason, this web application is an extremely helpful tool for the coordinators,\nspeakers and guests since you get real time feedback and questions. If I had to describe Conferience with\nfew key words I would say: fast, interactive, flexible, easy to use, innovative. Thank you very much for this\nnew experience.\nMarios Koumis\n-\nPremier & Advance Propositions Manager\n,\nCustomer Value Management, RBWM | HSBC Bank Plc\nThis year's Wealth Management Forum was outstanding! Panel participants were all excellent, as their\nexperience and in-depth knowledge of the business kept the audience 100% focused. The interactive real-\ntime survey through Conferience kept the interest alive throughout the event and\ndiscussions/presentations provided useful insights to the audience. Congratulations!\nGeorge Diakonikolaou Ph.D\n-\nPMP, Project Coach.\n,\nConferience is an excellent web-app, which enables you to directly and easily interact with the attendees of a conference or a training course - whether it is long or short. Apart from the incredible ability and the real time communication, the platform gives the possibility to the organizer of the event to easily create an event on his/her own. My personal experience with this platform at the event organization, as well at its use, is one of the most ideal of an IT tool; it concentrates on the event itself, on the interaction and the comments of the attendees, and not on technical complexity. In just one word, it is \"effective\".\nVassilios P. Bartzokas\n-\nCEO / Founder Archisearch.gr\n,\nOrganizer/Producer Esw [éso ] Conference\nConferience events platform revolutionizes the way attendees and event organizers share information, ideas and questions. Through their smartphones, our attendees were engaged by asking questions, rating speakers, providing feedback to the event organizers giving a new dimension to our event. Our audience enjoyed the use of Conferience and we will implement it to all our events\nSotiris Sirmakezis\n-\nGeneral Manager, Group Chief Digital & Technology Officer\n,\nEurobank\nConferience is an innovative web app solution bringing a totally new dimension in a corporate meeting.\nThe easiness of using it provided us a great help to collect ideas, feedback and outlooks from our\nexecutives. The features of agenda, questions, polling with live graphs, evaluation, feedback and raffle\nengaged us to a more than creative way giving a unique experience!\nBabis Divaris\n-\nTax partner\n,\nITAS PC\nConferience gives to audience the role of active participants. Using Conferience, each participant can\neasily vote, make questions or intervene with other ways. The application is very easy to understand and\nfriendly to use. The only device we need is a smartphone!\nAthina Kylafi\n-\nCommunications Manager\n,\nCorporate Communications, BASF Hellas S.A.\nConferience is an excellent, user friendly, easy to use tool. I think it could turn a conference, meeting or other event into a unique experience.\nTheodore Krintas\n-\nManaging Director\n,\nAttica Wealth Management - Greece\nConferience.com is a must in every conference. Live interaction with delegates creates a flawless experience for all!\nMaria Papacosta\n-\nManaging Director\n,\nHappy Creations\nWorking with Conferience has enabled us to provide a greater level of interaction for our clients’ meetings\nand events. Its ease of use and limitless possibilities have turned it into a tool for us that we can use from a\nsimple fun game to a more sophisticated poll. Thank you for the great service and continuous support!\nGiannis Tsiliras\n-\nConsumer CRM & Channel Management Director\n,\nOTE and COSMOTE\nConferience has been an important asset to our internal workshops and conferences over the past year. It\nchanged the way we interact with our people as we experienced even more engagement, participation and\nproductive dialogue. The system is easy to use, flexible and robust. The web-app interface offers a wide\nrange of capabilities such as real time questions, surveys, quizzes and evaluations, simplifying and\namplifying the process of feedback, hence facilitating the evaluation and the innovative approaches to\naddress key business challenges. I highly recommend this solution for conferences and corporate\nworkshops/meetings.\nJason Nathan\n-\nGlobal Multi-Channel Capability Director\n,\ndunnhumby\nJust wanted to say how effective and professional I found the Conferience system used at Shopper ID Conference 2014 event in Athens. Everything worked very smoothly, and I was particularly impressed by the questions/voting mechanic, which I had not seen before. It really helped me maximise the value of my Q&A session and that seemed to be the case for all the speakers as well.\nGeorge Zalokostas\n-\nCountry Media Manage\n,\nUnilever - Greece & Cyprus\nConferience is a great platform for managing the Q&A session in a conference. It is very easy to use, both for the administrator and for the participants. During our workshop, it encouraged the participation of the audience both by giving them the opportunity to enter questions and to vote for the ones that they found most interesting. At the same time, it enabled us (the organizers) to capture all questions, manage them according to their relevance to the Workshop's topic and prioritize them, based on likes, thus, manage efficiently the timing of the Q&A session. Additionally, the ex post full question report we received was very useful. In our next conferences, we intend to make use of Conferience’s Event Evaluation feature, in order to get constructive feedback avoiding printed evaluation forms.\nPanos Milias\n-\nDigital Media Manager\n,\nNestle Hellas SA\nConferience was a great experience in our event. It was very well-received that managed to engage and\nmotivate our audience to make questions. I would definitely suggest it in internal events, as many\ncolleagues do not have the courage to make a question orally. Additionally, the audience has the\nopportunity to check what is being asked, vote in case someone has the same question and think what else\ncould be asked. Then, the dialogue begins!!!\nJohn Kyriopoulos\n-\nProfessor Emeritus of Health Economics\n,\nNational School of Public Health\nThe \"Conferience\" was used at the 13th Healthworld Conference for televoting needs among several participants. I consider that the features and tools of this application are user-friendly and suitable for constructing and eventually conducting an interactive assessment in real time and with great success. I strongly recommend it.\nAnna Gousiou\n-\nProduct Manager, Diabetes Business Unit\n,\nNovo Nordisk Ltd.\nThe service provided by Conferience was of high quality, adding value and contributing to the success of our satellite symposium. Both the audience and the speakers positively evaluated the televoting system as a simple and valuable tool that made the event interactive and interesting. We look forward to our next cooperation!\nMary Georgiadou\n-\nChairman of the Executive Committee\n,\nHellenic Institute of Human Resources Management\nOn 6th of November 2014, the Hellenic Institute of Human Resources Management of the Hellenic Management Association organized its 5th Annual Conference under the title \"The Big HR Debate - HR Reloading\". The Organizing Committee of the Conference, decided to use for the first time the innovative application of Conferience.\nWith the use of Conferience, the participants of our conference were excited to be able to actively participate throughout the various sessions of the conference by simply using their smart devices.\nWe will definitely use Conferience in other events and conferences in the future.\nKonstantinos Tsiptsis\n-\nCRM & Customer Intelligence Manager\n,\nEurobank\nWe had the opportunity to use Conferience in the framework of an internal workshop on campaign management. More than fifty participants had the opportunity to submit questions and rank them according to their preferences. Conferience managed not only to increase the number of questions through anonymity, but also to add some fun by the use of the ‘Like’ option to everyone else’s questions.\nDiana Engelbrecht\n-\nMarketing Manager\n,\nat Digital Ship\nUsing conferience.com added a new level of engagement between our speakers and audience. We\nreceived positive feedback from our enthusiastic users. Having the option to update the agenda on site\nwas an advantage when sessions ran late, and the program was moved around to accommodate the\nchanges. The system is easy to use, and the support team is very helpful and friendly.\nPanagiotis  Tsantilas\n-\nMarketing Manager\n,\nTraining Center Coordinator SEE, ME, SA, Africa\nKnauf Hellas\nWe decided to use Conferience for the first time during our 25 years ceremony convention organized for our key partners. Conferience proved to be a pleasant experience for us and an elegant, friendly user tool for the users that managed to deliver what initially has been promised. Conferience team high level support was continuous throughout the entire event keeping all of us reluctant and secure for the final result. We look forward to using Conferience into similar projects in the future.\nTheofanis Giotis, MSc, Ph.D. C., PMP, CSM, CSP\n-\nCEO of 12PM Consulting (ITEC Consulting)\n,\n1988-now\nOn every event your run worldwide, training or conference, you have a single issue: How to handle participants’ questions? Conferience gives a perfect solution to this single issue. Conferience is an easy to use web application that anyone can use in seconds. Participants can directly and easily interact with the organizers giving them the opportunity and ability to interact in a real time environment. My personal experience with this platform during the Project Management Conference 2014 (\nwww.pmconference.gr\n) was excellent. A must use tool  for all events!!!\nNick Androulakis\n-\nLogistics Coordinator\n,\nIEEE ECE 360\nConferience gave us what we were looking for and upgraded our event to the next level. We broke down the walls between our panel and our audience! The feedback we got through the app was a nice feature we used it afterwards for our self-evaluation!\nGeorgios Sokolakis\n-\nCommercial Sales Manager\n,\nFrezyderm S.A.\nThe first time I used Conferience was in December 2015, during a training program for the sales\ndepartment of Frezyderm, where I work as a commercial manager. Since the idea of innovation is\ninextricably linked with Frezyderm, I am constantly searching for programs, techniques and ideas that\nwill contribute to improving the organization and achieving a better function and training of the sales\ndepartment. Choosing Conferience in order to train the sales department proved to be excellent. It justly\nmet the demands I had set. The training of a department that consists of many people is demanding and\nusually difficult, which means that we have to overcome any difficulties by finding the adequate tools or\nsuccessful ways to do so. Conferience passed the test! Except for the fact that it impressed the\nparticipants, it managed to improve the training as far as time, participation, results and conclusions are\nconcerned. The ability it provided when carrying out statistical results in reference to the training, as well\nas individual performance of the participants, gave us feedback to use during the next training cycle. The\nuse of back office was easy after the support and help I had from the Conferience team. The support was\nexcellent and ready to provide solutions. I will definitely use Conferience again in the next training cycle or\nconference!\nAgathi Pafili\n-\nSenior Regulatory Policy Advisor\n,\nEuropean Fund and Asset Management Association (EFAMA)\nConferience is a great tool that allows a true interaction between speakers and audience in a fast, easy and efficient way. It allows the right questions to be put on the table and an exchange of views with as many of the participants wish to raise their voice. It therefore makes a conference more lively and interesting to everyone.\nSEN/JA\n-\nAlumni Greece\n,\nWe tested Conferience in one of our events and now we are trying to use it in every single one! It can\nturn a good experience into an amazing one by simply adding the parameter of interaction. More than 80%\nof the attendees used it and the result was amazing. Questions didn't seem to end, hearing even the shyest\nattendees' opinion and the results of the pols gave us important feedback for further actions. Undoubtedly\nit is going to become a must for every informal, social or business event organized in the future.\nMarianna  Kalendi\n-\nGeneral Secretariat\n,\nDigital Policy | Ministry of Digital Policy, Telecommunications & Media\nThe platform contributed significantly to the success of our event and the collection of the participants’ questions ran smoothly before as well as during the course of the event.\nChristiana Koudigkeli\n-\nLogistics Coordinator\n,\nJob Fair Athens 2015\nConferience definitely brought our event and our Q&A sessions to the next level. We used it to bring\ntogether our audience and the speakers in a more interactive and modern way. It was the second year in a\nrow that we decided to get involved with Conferience and the feedback we received from the users helped\nus reevaluate our agenda and gave us valuable ideas that we’ll try to implement next year. The platform is\nuser-friendly and innovating. We would strongly suggest it for similar panels and events.\nChristi Mousioni\n-\nSales Institute in Greece\n,\nOperations Manager\nConferience is an interactive and helpful event app for the participants and administrators. I would like to thank the Conferience team for the great support!\nVasileios Gongolidis\n-\nGeneral Secretariat for Research & Technology\n,\nMember of the organizing committee of the 2nd Technology Forum 2015\nThe web application Conferience made it easier for the moderators of the various sessions to interact with the audience through their smartphones and evaluate the speakers as well as the whole event. Additionally, the report we received after the conclusion of the event was very useful. The organizing committee considers using Conferience on a permanent basis for future events. The 2nd Technology Forum was co organized by the Association of Information Technology Companies of Northern Greece, Centre for Research and Technology-Hellas, Greek International Business Association, Federation of Industries of Northern Greece, Aristotle University, University of Macedonia, under the auspices of Alexander Innovation Zone, General Secretariat for Research & Technology and International Hellenic University. The purpose of the Forum was to promote new technologies as well as synergies between enterprises and academic/research institutions on the ICT sector.\nRenata Papadimitriou\n-\nManaging Director\n,\nThe PR Corp.\nConferience was chosen to be the element that will convert our client’s meeting to an open channel of communication among the presenter and the audience within the room and the one attending remotely! Goal achieved 100% providing optimum feedback!\nThanos Paraschos\n-\nFounder of Youth Entrepreneurship Club\n,\nCEO of iprovidenow Ltd\nWe used Conferience during Pan-European Startup Europe Week event 2016 in Chania-Crete, which was\nheld simultaneously in 40 countries and 200+ cities in Europe, and it was the first big -scale event to be\norganized by Youth Entrepreneurship Club as an ambassador! The pressure to achieve an organization of\nhigh quality was intense. Given the theme of our event, we chose Conferience as an example of a\nsuccessful Startup and we were not disappointed. On the contrary, Conferience confirmed its reputation\nand exceeded our expectations.Its usage was simple and easy, it contributed to the overall experience of\nour audience who were able to conveniently place questions and remarks without the stress of verbal\ncommunication or interrupting the flow of discussion. Through a democratic procedure, the best question\nwas voted to finally be addressed to the speakers, promoting the conversation. Conferience team was\n100% alert and supportive to provide any guidance we needed, and the platform responded excellently\nduring the discussion as well as during the evaluation of the event and the polls in the startup pitching\ncontest. In the end we were able to quickly receive poll results, analytic infographics, as well as exported\ndata and statistics, yielding valuable information about audience engagement and feedback. Conferience\nmajorly enhanced satisfaction and overall success of our event, impressing our audience and providing\nuseful tools to calculate variables of this success. It has been a problem solver. Using Conferience in the\nfuture for similar events, is recommended and for us, it is a given.\nTimo Lahnalampi\n-\nSenior Consultant\n,\nGiulia Pastor, Consultant\nWe found the Conferience tool very useful, especially for creating interactivity and asking questions in an event with a very tight timeline. The response from the audience was positive: a lot of questions were asked via the tool providing a good basis for the Q&A part of the session and creating a positive feedback for us\nPaul  Hourlias\n-\nMarketing & Tech Manager at Youth Entrepreneurship Club\n,\nAfter the successful Startup Europe Week, we organized in Chania, Crete last year, this year we decided\nto level up organizing it in Chania as well as in Heraklion and Rethymnon. Knowing that, especially in\nthese big-scale events,\nthere is a gap between the audience and the speakers, we decided to use the features of Conferience to\nbridge it. Having used Conferience last year we found out that all the features were renewed, and the new\ninterface was even more simplified. Apart from that, the questions feature was the highlight of them\nall, impressing all of the speakers along with the audience which was able to make anonymous questions\nwithout any hassle at all. The majority of the audience used it and the results were truly amazing. It gave\nthe event an extraordinary spark setting it apart from others. The questions feature also has the\ndemocratic option of liking questions, so the top ones can be answered first. Inasmuch as this year\nStartup Europe Week Crete 2017 was a chain of events throughout the week the event evaluation feature\nthat is provided through Conferience was certainly very helpful. At the end of the event we could take a\nlook at the responses the audience left and correct some potential mistakes for the next event. The same\nthing could be done with the event report that the Conferience team instantly sent us. The team was\nextremely helpful and responsive and could provide us with any information needed. Using Conferience in\nStartup Europe Week Crete 2017 was undoubtedly very helpful for us and is recommended for similar\nevents.\nFotis Fotopoulos\n-\nPresident of the Board of the Panhellenic Association of Translators\n,\nConferience provided us with the necessary tools to boost interaction between the speakers and the audience and meet the fundamental goals of our conference, which were true engagement and communication.\nSofia Cruickshank\n-\nBusiness Administrator\n,\nNext Level Information Ltd\nConferience allowed us to move away from a traditional printed event guide and enabled our attendees to\ninteract with speakers anonymously or not, participate in workshops & sessions, vote on polls, view the\nattendees’ list/agenda/speaker profiles/sponsor profiles and receive important announcements. The\nsupport leading up to and throughout the event was extremely responsive and professional, the team\nmade the impossible possible by creating new features within the app to fulfil our needs! Most\nimportantly, we were able to make amendments to any content from the back office seamlessly and our\nattendees found the app very user-friendly. We will definitely use Conferience for future events of the\nsame model.\nOlympia  Kokka\n-\nExecutive Director\n,\nYouth Entrepreneurship Club\nIt was the third year in a row that we used the Conferience during the Pan-European Conference Startup\nEurope Week Crete that was held in 4 different cities. Every year we are impressed with the features\nadded such as attendees networking, speakers’ evaluation and event evaluation which is a valuable\nfeedback. It's a great tool that engages the audience and upgrades the level of a conference. We will\ndefinitely use it in our next events.\nIoannis Nikolaou\n-\nAssociate Professor of Organizational Behaviour, Work & Organizational Psychologist\n,\nAthens University of Economics and Business\nConferience has been our main partner during the two recent Human Resource Management Conferences we organize every two years here at the Athens University of economics and Business. Conferience team has been really professional, very responsive, dealing effectively, accurately and efficiently with all our requests, even under very limited (if any at all) time. Conferience is a very good solution for any kind of meetings and conferences providing high quality services and solutions.\nFotis Psarros\n-\nAllergologist\n,\nSecretary General of 12th Panhellenic Congress of Allergy and Clinical Immunology\nWe decided to use the \"Conferience\" application during the 12th Panhellenic Congress of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, which was held at the Megaron, the Athens concert hall, from the 29th of March until the 1st of April 2018. The conventional medical conference was converted into an interactive, exciting, event due to the app. There was a keen interest in debate sessions and questions from the audience. On behalf of the Conference President, the Board of Directors of the Hellenic Society of Allergy and Clinical Immunology and all participants, I would like to express our genuine thanks to the \"Conferience\" team for their contribution to such a successful conference.\nNerina Komioti\n-\nDirector General\n,\nHellenic Advertisers, Association (SDE)\nConferience is a great platform for managing the Q&A session in a conference. It is very easy to use, both for the administrator and for the participants. During our workshop, it encouraged the participation of the audience both by giving them the opportunity to enter questions and to vote for the ones that they found most interesting. At the same time, it enabled us (the organizers) to capture all questions, manage them according to their relevance to the Workshop's topic and prioritize them, based on likes, thus, manage efficiently the timing of the Q&A session. Additionally, the ex post full question report we received was very useful. In our next conferences, we intend to make use of Conferience’s Event Evaluation feature, in order to get constructive feedback avoiding printed evaluation forms.\nKonstantinos Kallinteris\n-\nProject Curator of PharmACon (Pharmaceutical Athenian Congress)\n,\nConferience was the most pioneering application in our congress. First and foremost, Conferience provided participants the opportunity to submit their questions, assess speakers’ performance and be informed about our agenda and sponsors. In particular, this innovative web app enriched our congress and contributed to the immediate interaction between attendees and our team. In other words, it was conducive to the improvement of our plan during the event and it enhanced the development of our social network. The support was excellent and ready to provide solutions. All things considered, Conferience was tailored to our needs and we are going to use it again in the future\nAlexandra Lamprou\n-\nPresident of Greek Pharmaceutical Students’ Federation.\n,\nWe used Conferience in our two latest events. It is a very useful application because the questions ran smoothly during the course of the event. Most of the participants evaluated the speakers and voted the questions they wanted to be answered. The contribution of the platform was significant to the success  of our events.\nTrusted by / Our cl\ni\nents\nContact Us\nLet's get in touch!\nOnline Services\ninfo@conferience.com\nOnline Contact\n+30-210.6846329 (GR)\n+44 118 328 0124 (UK)\nOffice Address\n12 Bishop Street, Leicester LE1 6AF\nUnited Kingdom\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail Address\nSubject\nMessage\nYou are just\n1 step\naway from staying in touch with us.\nSend Now\nWhy buy Conferience?\nAll in one.

conferience.com at our first conference and we got enthusiastic reviews by the event delegates. Conferience.com has a new style in the way the participants interact with the speakers of our conferences. They ask questions through the web-app, anonymously or not, the most popular questions appear to everybody and the conversation gets a new approach and becomes more interesting! Even foreign speakers have given very positive reviews about the interesting questions that are uploaded during their presentations. The agenda is always updated with full details of the panels and the speakers. In the future, all other features of the platform, such as speaker evaluation or the raffle and participation option, are going to add value to the conferences of Boussias Communications.\n           </p>\n          </div>\n         </div>\n         <div>\n          <div>\n           <div>\n            <div>\n             <img alt=\"\" src=\"/web/images/testimonials/clarke.jpg\"/>\n            </div>\n            <div>\n             <h5>\n              Steve Clarke\n             </h5>\n             <p>\n              -\n              <b>\n               Sales Mentor, Author,\n              </b>\n              ,\n              <b>\n               Inspirational Business Speaker\n              </b>\n             </p>\n            </div>\n            <div>\n            </div>\n           </div>\n           <p>\n            I am very impressed by the web-app \"Conferience\" a great way to interact with an audience.

Helped tremendously in preparation of the content and the questions, but more important was the high increase of the interaction with participants surpassing the 90%. Needless to mention that an overall assessment of the summit was “excellent”. Since then, I use “Conferience” to any seminar, conference, summit, and workshop. For me is a valuable tool that helps me both in organization and in effective coordination and communication with participants. Important is the continuous support provided to the product, in order to adapt specific needs, frequently upgraded with new features. I strongly recommend “Conferience”, adds value and makes the difference!\n           </p>\n          </div>\n         </div>\n         <div>\n          <div>\n           <div>\n            <div>\n             <img alt=\"\" src=\"/web/images/testimonials/michaelidis.jpg\"/>\n            </div>\n            <div>\n             <h5>\n              Angelina Michaelidis\n             </h5>\n             <p>\n              -\n              <b>\n               General Manager\n              </b>\n              ,\n              <b>\n               Response International S.A.\n              </b>\n             </p>\n            </div>\n            <div>\n            </div>\n           </div>\n           <p>\n            Conferience is an interactive tool that adds value to the time I devote for business conferences.

In a world where computer science and technology are advancing and\nevolving at great speed, Conferience gives us the opportunity to welcome our audience to a “new\ndimension”, where attending a conference has ceased to be a “passive” process, as the participants are\nenabled to ask questions and to evaluate the speeches as well as the conference as a whole in real time.\nThis is a tool which has given a unique “note” to our conferences.

The web-app interface offers a wide\nrange of capabilities such as real time questions, surveys, quizzes and evaluations, simplifying and\namplifying the process of feedback, hence facilitating the evaluation and the innovative approaches to\naddress key business challenges.

It is very easy to use, both for the administrator and for the participants. During our workshop, it encouraged the participation of the audience both by giving them the opportunity to enter questions and to vote for the ones that they found most interesting. At the same time, it enabled us (the organizers) to capture all questions, manage them according to their relevance to the Workshop's topic and prioritize them, based on likes, thus, manage efficiently the timing of the Q&amp;A session. Additionally, the ex post full question report we received was very useful. In our next conferences, we intend to make use of Conferience’s Event Evaluation feature, in order to get constructive feedback avoiding printed evaluation forms.\n           </p>\n          </div>\n         </div>\n         <div>\n          <div>\n           <div>\n            <div>\n             <img alt=\"\" src=\"/web/images/testimonials/milias.jpg\"/>\n            </div>\n            <div>\n             <h5>\n              Panos Milias\n             </h5>\n             <p>\n              -\n              <b>\n               Digital Media Manager\n              </b>\n              ,\n              <b>\n               Nestle Hellas SA\n              </b>\n             </p>\n            </div>\n            <div>\n            </div>\n           </div>\n           <p>\n            Conferience was a great experience in our event. It was very well-received that managed to engage and\nmotivate our audience to make questions. I would definitely suggest it in internal events, as many\ncolleagues do not have the courage to make a question orally. Additionally, the audience has the\nopportunity to check what is being asked, vote in case someone has the same question and think what else\ncould be asked. Then, the dialogue begins!!!\n           </p>\n          </div>\n         </div>\n         <div>\n          <div>\n           <div>\n            <div>\n             <img alt=\"\" src=\"/web/images/testimonials/kyriopoulos.jpg\"/>\n            </div>\n            <div>\n             <h5>\n              John Kyriopoulos\n             </h5>\n             <p>\n              -\n              <b>\n               Professor Emeritus of Health Economics\n              </b>\n              ,\n              <b>\n               National School of Public Health\n              </b>\n             </p>\n            </div>\n            <div>\n            </div>\n           </div>\n           <p>\n            The \"Conferience\" was used at the 13th Healthworld Conference for televoting needs among several participants.

Since the idea of innovation is\ninextricably linked with Frezyderm, I am constantly searching for programs, techniques and ideas that\nwill contribute to improving the organization and achieving a better function and training of the sales\ndepartment. Choosing Conferience in order to train the sales department proved to be excellent. It justly\nmet the demands I had set. The training of a department that consists of many people is demanding and\nusually difficult, which means that we have to overcome any difficulties by finding the adequate tools or\nsuccessful ways to do so. Conferience passed the test! Except for the fact that it impressed the\nparticipants, it managed to improve the training as far as time, participation, results and conclusions are\nconcerned. The ability it provided when carrying out statistical results in reference to the training, as well\nas individual performance of the participants, gave us feedback to use during the next training cycle. The\nuse of back office was easy after the support and help I had from the Conferience team. The support was\nexcellent and ready to provide solutions. I will definitely use Conferience again in the next training cycle or\nconference!\n           </p>\n          </div>\n         </div>\n         <div>\n          <div>\n           <div>\n            <div>\n             <img alt=\"\" src=\"/web/images/testimonials/pafili.jpg\"/>\n            </div>\n            <div>\n             <h5>\n              Agathi Pafili\n             </h5>\n             <p>\n              -\n              <b>\n               Senior Regulatory Policy Advisor\n              </b>\n              ,\n              <b>\n               European Fund and Asset Management Association (EFAMA)\n              </b>\n             </p>\n            </div>\n            <div>\n            </div>\n           </div>\n           <p>\n            Conferience is a great tool that allows a true interaction between speakers and audience in a fast, easy and efficient way.

Questions didn't seem to end, hearing even the shyest\n\nattendees' opinion and the results of the pols gave us important feedback for further actions.

The pressure to achieve an organization of\nhigh quality was intense. Given the theme of our event, we chose Conferience as an example of a\nsuccessful Startup and we were not disappointed. On the contrary, Conferience confirmed its reputation\nand exceeded our expectations.Its usage was simple and easy, it contributed to the overall experience of\nour audience who were able to conveniently place questions and remarks without the stress of verbal\ncommunication or interrupting the flow of discussion. Through a democratic procedure, the best question\nwas voted to finally be addressed to the speakers, promoting the conversation. Conferience team was\n100% alert and supportive to provide any guidance we needed, and the platform responded excellently\nduring the discussion as well as during the evaluation of the event and the polls in the startup pitching\ncontest. In the end we were able to quickly receive poll results, analytic infographics, as well as exported\ndata and statistics, yielding valuable information about audience engagement and feedback. Conferience\nmajorly enhanced satisfaction and overall success of our event, impressing our audience and providing\nuseful tools to calculate variables of this success. It has been a problem solver. Using Conferience in the\nfuture for similar events, is recommended and for us, it is a given.\n           </p>\n          </div>\n         </div>\n         <div>\n          <div>\n           <div>\n            <div>\n             <img alt=\"\" src=\"/web/images/testimonials/interinnov.png\"/>\n            </div>\n            <div>\n             <h5>\n              Timo Lahnalampi\n             </h5>\n             <p>\n              -\n              <b>\n               Senior Consultant\n              </b>\n              ,\n              <b>\n               Giulia Pastor, Consultant\n              </b>\n             </p>\n            </div>\n            <div>\n            </div>\n           </div>\n           <p>\n            We found the Conferience tool very useful, especially for creating interactivity and asking questions in an event with a very tight timeline.

Knowing that, especially in\nthese big-scale events,\nthere is a gap between the audience and the speakers, we decided to use the features of Conferience to\nbridge it. Having used Conferience last year we found out that all the features were renewed, and the new\ninterface was even more simplified. Apart from that, the questions feature was the highlight of them\nall, impressing all of the speakers along with the audience which was able to make anonymous questions\nwithout any hassle at all. The majority of the audience used it and the results were truly amazing. It gave\nthe event an extraordinary spark setting it apart from others. The questions feature also has the\ndemocratic option of liking questions, so the top ones can be answered first. Inasmuch as this year\nStartup Europe Week Crete 2017 was a chain of events throughout the week the event evaluation feature\nthat is provided through Conferience was certainly very helpful. At the end of the event we could take a\nlook at the responses the audience left and correct some potential mistakes for the next event. The same\nthing could be done with the event report that the Conferience team instantly sent us. The team was\nextremely helpful and responsive and could provide us with any information needed. Using Conferience in\nStartup Europe Week Crete 2017 was undoubtedly very helpful for us and is recommended for similar\nevents.\n           </p>\n          </div>\n         </div>\n         <div>\n          <div>\n           <div>\n            <div>\n             <img alt=\"\" src=\"/web/images/testimonials/PAoT.png\"/>\n            </div>\n            <div>\n             <h5>\n              Fotis Fotopoulos\n             </h5>\n             <p>\n              -\n              <b>\n               President of the Board of the Panhellenic Association of Translators\n              </b>\n              ,\n             </p>\n            </div>\n            <div>\n            </div>\n           </div>\n           <p>\n            Conferience provided us with the necessary tools to boost interaction between the speakers and the audience and meet the fundamental goals of our conference, which were true engagement and communication.\n           </p>\n          </div>\n         </div>\n         <div>\n          <div>\n           <div>\n            <div>\n             <img alt=\"\" src=\"/web/images/testimonials/sofia.png\"/>\n            </div>\n            <div>\n             <h5>\n              Sofia Cruickshank\n             </h5>\n             <p>\n              -\n              <b>\n               Business Administrator\n              </b>\n              ,\n              <b>\n               Next Level Information Ltd\n              </b>\n             </p>\n            </div>\n            <div>\n            </div>\n           </div>\n           <p>\n            Conferience allowed us to move away from a traditional printed event guide and enabled our attendees to\ninteract with speakers anonymously or not, participate in workshops &amp; sessions, vote on polls, view the\nattendees’ list/agenda/speaker profiles/sponsor profiles and receive important announcements. The\nsupport leading up to and throughout the event was extremely responsive and professional, the team\nmade the impossible possible by creating new features within the app to fulfil our needs! Most\nimportantly, we were able to make amendments to any content from the back office seamlessly and our\nattendees found the app very user-friendly.

The conventional medical conference was converted into an interactive, exciting, event due to the app. There was a keen interest in debate sessions and questions from the audience.

It is very easy to use, both for the administrator and for the participants. During our workshop, it encouraged the participation of the audience both by giving them the opportunity to enter questions and to vote for the ones that they found most interesting. At the same time, it enabled us (the organizers) to capture all questions, manage them according to their relevance to the Workshop's topic and prioritize them, based on likes, thus, manage efficiently the timing of the Q&amp;A session. Additionally, the ex post full question report we received was very useful. In our next conferences, we intend to make use of Conferience’s Event Evaluation feature, in order to get constructive feedback avoiding printed evaluation forms.\n           </p>\n          </div>\n         </div>\n         <div>\n          <div>\n           <div>\n            <div>\n             <img alt=\"\" src=\"/web/images/testimonials/KonstantinosKallinteris.jpg\"/>\n            </div>\n            <div>\n             <h5>\n              Konstantinos Kallinteris\n             </h5>\n             <p>\n              -\n              <b>\n               Project Curator of PharmACon (Pharmaceutical Athenian Congress)\n              </b>\n              ,\n             </p>\n            </div>\n            <div>\n            </div>\n           </div>\n           <p>\n            Conferience was the most pioneering application in our congress.

In particular, this innovative web app enriched our congress and contributed to the immediate interaction between attendees and our team. In other words, it was conducive to the improvement of our plan during the event and it enhanced the development of our social network. The support was excellent and ready to provide solutions. All things considered, Conferience was tailored to our needs and we are going to use it again in the future\n           </p>\n          </div>\n         </div>\n         <div>\n          <div>\n           <div>\n            <div>\n             <img alt=\"\" src=\"/web/images/testimonials/LamprouAlexandra.jpg\"/>\n            </div>\n            <div>\n             <h5>\n              Alexandra Lamprou\n             </h5>\n             <p>\n              -\n              <b>\n               President of Greek Pharmaceutical Students’ Federation.\n              </b>\n              ,\n             </p>\n            </div>\n            <div>\n            </div>\n           </div>\n           <p>\n            We used Conferience in our two latest events.

Conferience.com has a new style in the way the participants interact with the speakers of our conferences. They ask questions through the web-app, anonymously or not, the most popular questions appear to everybody and the conversation gets a new approach and becomes more interesting! Even foreign speakers have given very positive reviews about the interesting questions that are uploaded during their presentations. The agenda is always updated with full details of the panels and the speakers. In the future, all other features of the platform, such as speaker evaluation or the raffle and participation option, are going to add value to the conferences of Boussias Communications.\nSteve Clarke\n-\nSales Mentor, Author,\n,\nInspirational Business Speaker\nI am very impressed by the web-app \"Conferience\" a great way to interact with an audience. I will\ndefinitely use this at future conferences\nIakovos Giannaklis\n-\nHead of Branch Network\n,\nEurobank\nConferience provided an innovative and cost-effective solution to attracting questions and ideas from the\nparticipants in a number of internal meetings of our organization. Users were able to easily understand the\nnavigation and functionality of the system and they greatly appreciated the anonymity provided and the\nfact that they could raise questions to issues that were discussed in real time.\nDimitris Georgopoulos\n-\nPartner at Rethink Business Lab.\n,\nBusiness Development Advisor & Executive Coach\nI tested “Conferience”, for the first time at a summit about customer service, where I had the responsibility of coordinating with demanding high-level participants and panels with first class executives. “Conferience” made the difference! Helped tremendously in preparation of the content and the questions, but more important was the high increase of the interaction with participants surpassing the 90%. Needless to mention that an overall assessment of the summit was “excellent”. Since then, I use “Conferience” to any seminar, conference, summit, and workshop. For me is a valuable tool that helps me both in organization and in effective coordination and communication with participants. Important is the continuous support provided to the product, in order to adapt specific needs, frequently upgraded with new features. I strongly recommend “Conferience”, adds value and makes the difference!\nAngelina Michaelidis\n-\nGeneral Manager\n,\nResponse International S.A.\nConferience is an interactive tool that adds value to the time I devote for business conferences. The use of Conferience.com started as an exploration, smoothly, using its fantastic, very handy user-interface. Soon after, I was attracted by the different features, the power I acquire in my hands expressing my view and make my questions shared with the rest of the audience. From now on, I definitely prefer to attend conferences, if Conferience is available.\nKonstantinos Ouzounis\n-\nCEO\n,\nEthos Media S.A.\nConferience has proved an innovative and also smart application, as it allows interaction among the\nspeakers and the participants of our conferences. However, what really makes it stand out, is how\naccurately it responds to our needs. In a world where computer science and technology are advancing and\nevolving at great speed, Conferience gives us the opportunity to welcome our audience to a “new\ndimension”, where attending a conference has ceased to be a “passive” process, as the participants are\nenabled to ask questions and to evaluate the speeches as well as the conference as a whole in real time.\nThis is a tool which has given a unique “note” to our conferences. Thank you for adding value to our\nconferences.\nMichael R. Virardi\n-\nTrainer | Speaker | Author\n,\nConferience was not what I was waiting for to be developed. Conferience was what I needed to be developed!\nAntonis  Kotzamanidis\n-\nManaging Director\n,\nEntersoft S.A.\nWe have used the Conferience service in an internal personnel meeting for the first time this year. It\nactually proved to be a new interactive experience for the participants, both in posing questions and in\nspecific polls which took place during the meeting. It performed beyond our expectations, as it helped to\ncollect essential feedback from participants and made presentations more pleasant. I strongly recommend\nit and we will definitely use it again in future events.\nIsavella Vitou\n-\nGroup Transformation Sector, Group Strategy\n,\nEurobank Ergasias SA\nConferience is an innovative and very user-friendly application. The competitive advantage of\nConferience is that it can be accessed easily and quickly by any smart phone device that is connected to\nthe internet. For this reason, this web application is an extremely helpful tool for the coordinators,\nspeakers and guests since you get real time feedback and questions. If I had to describe Conferience with\nfew key words I would say: fast, interactive, flexible, easy to use, innovative. Thank you very much for this\nnew experience.\nMarios Koumis\n-\nPremier & Advance Propositions Manager\n,\nCustomer Value Management, RBWM | HSBC Bank Plc\nThis year's Wealth Management Forum was outstanding! Panel participants were all excellent, as their\nexperience and in-depth knowledge of the business kept the audience 100% focused. The interactive real-\ntime survey through Conferience kept the interest alive throughout the event and\ndiscussions/presentations provided useful insights to the audience. Congratulations!\nGeorge Diakonikolaou Ph.D\n-\nPMP, Project Coach.\n,\nConferience is an excellent web-app, which enables you to directly and easily interact with the attendees of a conference or a training course - whether it is long or short. Apart from the incredible ability and the real time communication, the platform gives the possibility to the organizer of the event to easily create an event on his/her own. My personal experience with this platform at the event organization, as well at its use, is one of the most ideal of an IT tool; it concentrates on the event itself, on the interaction and the comments of the attendees, and not on technical complexity. In just one word, it is \"effective\".\nVassilios P. Bartzokas\n-\nCEO / Founder Archisearch.gr\n,\nOrganizer/Producer Esw [éso ] Conference\nConferience events platform revolutionizes the way attendees and event organizers share information, ideas and questions. Through their smartphones, our attendees were engaged by asking questions, rating speakers, providing feedback to the event organizers giving a new dimension to our event. Our audience enjoyed the use of Conferience and we will implement it to all our events\nSotiris Sirmakezis\n-\nGeneral Manager, Group Chief Digital & Technology Officer\n,\nEurobank\nConferience is an innovative web app solution bringing a totally new dimension in a corporate meeting.\nThe easiness of using it provided us a great help to collect ideas, feedback and outlooks from our\nexecutives. The features of agenda, questions, polling with live graphs, evaluation, feedback and raffle\nengaged us to a more than creative way giving a unique experience!\nBabis Divaris\n-\nTax partner\n,\nITAS PC\nConferience gives to audience the role of active participants. Using Conferience, each participant can\neasily vote, make questions or intervene with other ways. The application is very easy to understand and\nfriendly to use. The only device we need is a smartphone!\nAthina Kylafi\n-\nCommunications Manager\n,\nCorporate Communications, BASF Hellas S.A.\nConferience is an excellent, user friendly, easy to use tool. I think it could turn a conference, meeting or other event into a unique experience.\nTheodore Krintas\n-\nManaging Director\n,\nAttica Wealth Management - Greece\nConferience.com is a must in every conference. Live interaction with delegates creates a flawless experience for all!\nMaria Papacosta\n-\nManaging Director\n,\nHappy Creations\nWorking with Conferience has enabled us to provide a greater level of interaction for our clients’ meetings\nand events. Its ease of use and limitless possibilities have turned it into a tool for us that we can use from a\nsimple fun game to a more sophisticated poll. Thank you for the great service and continuous support!\nGiannis Tsiliras\n-\nConsumer CRM & Channel Management Director\n,\nOTE and COSMOTE\nConferience has been an important asset to our internal workshops and conferences over the past year. It\nchanged the way we interact with our people as we experienced even more engagement, participation and\nproductive dialogue. The system is easy to use, flexible and robust. The web-app interface offers a wide\nrange of capabilities such as real time questions, surveys, quizzes and evaluations, simplifying and\namplifying the process of feedback, hence facilitating the evaluation and the innovative approaches to\naddress key business challenges. I highly recommend this solution for conferences and corporate\nworkshops/meetings.\nJason Nathan\n-\nGlobal Multi-Channel Capability Director\n,\ndunnhumby\nJust wanted to say how effective and professional I found the Conferience system used at Shopper ID Conference 2014 event in Athens. Everything worked very smoothly, and I was particularly impressed by the questions/voting mechanic, which I had not seen before. It really helped me maximise the value of my Q&A session and that seemed to be the case for all the speakers as well.\nGeorge Zalokostas\n-\nCountry Media Manage\n,\nUnilever - Greece & Cyprus\nConferience is a great platform for managing the Q&A session in a conference. It is very easy to use, both for the administrator and for the participants. During our workshop, it encouraged the participation of the audience both by giving them the opportunity to enter questions and to vote for the ones that they found most interesting. At the same time, it enabled us (the organizers) to capture all questions, manage them according to their relevance to the Workshop's topic and prioritize them, based on likes, thus, manage efficiently the timing of the Q&A session. Additionally, the ex post full question report we received was very useful. In our next conferences, we intend to make use of Conferience’s Event Evaluation feature, in order to get constructive feedback avoiding printed evaluation forms.\nPanos Milias\n-\nDigital Media Manager\n,\nNestle Hellas SA\nConferience was a great experience in our event. It was very well-received that managed to engage and\nmotivate our audience to make questions. I would definitely suggest it in internal events, as many\ncolleagues do not have the courage to make a question orally. Additionally, the audience has the\nopportunity to check what is being asked, vote in case someone has the same question and think what else\ncould be asked. Then, the dialogue begins!!!\nJohn Kyriopoulos\n-\nProfessor Emeritus of Health Economics\n,\nNational School of Public Health\nThe \"Conferience\" was used at the 13th Healthworld Conference for televoting needs among several participants. I consider that the features and tools of this application are user-friendly and suitable for constructing and eventually conducting an interactive assessment in real time and with great success. I strongly recommend it.\nAnna Gousiou\n-\nProduct Manager, Diabetes Business Unit\n,\nNovo Nordisk Ltd.\nThe service provided by Conferience was of high quality, adding value and contributing to the success of our satellite symposium. Both the audience and the speakers positively evaluated the televoting system as a simple and valuable tool that made the event interactive and interesting. We look forward to our next cooperation!\nMary Georgiadou\n-\nChairman of the Executive Committee\n,\nHellenic Institute of Human Resources Management\nOn 6th of November 2014, the Hellenic Institute of Human Resources Management of the Hellenic Management Association organized its 5th Annual Conference under the title \"The Big HR Debate - HR Reloading\". The Organizing Committee of the Conference, decided to use for the first time the innovative application of Conferience.\nWith the use of Conferience, the participants of our conference were excited to be able to actively participate throughout the various sessions of the conference by simply using their smart devices.\nWe will definitely use Conferience in other events and conferences in the future.\nKonstantinos Tsiptsis\n-\nCRM & Customer Intelligence Manager\n,\nEurobank\nWe had the opportunity to use Conferience in the framework of an internal workshop on campaign management. More than fifty participants had the opportunity to submit questions and rank them according to their preferences. Conferience managed not only to increase the number of questions through anonymity, but also to add some fun by the use of the ‘Like’ option to everyone else’s questions.\nDiana Engelbrecht\n-\nMarketing Manager\n,\nat Digital Ship\nUsing conferience.com added a new level of engagement between our speakers and audience. We\nreceived positive feedback from our enthusiastic users. Having the option to update the agenda on site\nwas an advantage when sessions ran late, and the program was moved around to accommodate the\nchanges. The system is easy to use, and the support team is very helpful and friendly.\nPanagiotis  Tsantilas\n-\nMarketing Manager\n,\nTraining Center Coordinator SEE, ME, SA, Africa\nKnauf Hellas\nWe decided to use Conferience for the first time during our 25 years ceremony convention organized for our key partners. Conferience proved to be a pleasant experience for us and an elegant, friendly user tool for the users that managed to deliver what initially has been promised. Conferience team high level support was continuous throughout the entire event keeping all of us reluctant and secure for the final result. We look forward to using Conferience into similar projects in the future.\nTheofanis Giotis, MSc, Ph.D. C., PMP, CSM, CSP\n-\nCEO of 12PM Consulting (ITEC Consulting)\n,\n1988-now\nOn every event your run worldwide, training or conference, you have a single issue: How to handle participants’ questions? Conferience gives a perfect solution to this single issue. Conferience is an easy to use web application that anyone can use in seconds. Participants can directly and easily interact with the organizers giving them the opportunity and ability to interact in a real time environment. My personal experience with this platform during the Project Management Conference 2014 (\nwww.pmconference.gr\n) was excellent. A must use tool  for all events!!!\nNick Androulakis\n-\nLogistics Coordinator\n,\nIEEE ECE 360\nConferience gave us what we were looking for and upgraded our event to the next level. We broke down the walls between our panel and our audience! The feedback we got through the app was a nice feature we used it afterwards for our self-evaluation!\nGeorgios Sokolakis\n-\nCommercial Sales Manager\n,\nFrezyderm S.A.\nThe first time I used Conferience was in December 2015, during a training program for the sales\ndepartment of Frezyderm, where I work as a commercial manager. Since the idea of innovation is\ninextricably linked with Frezyderm, I am constantly searching for programs, techniques and ideas that\nwill contribute to improving the organization and achieving a better function and training of the sales\ndepartment. Choosing Conferience in order to train the sales department proved to be excellent. It justly\nmet the demands I had set. The training of a department that consists of many people is demanding and\nusually difficult, which means that we have to overcome any difficulties by finding the adequate tools or\nsuccessful ways to do so. Conferience passed the test! Except for the fact that it impressed the\nparticipants, it managed to improve the training as far as time, participation, results and conclusions are\nconcerned. The ability it provided when carrying out statistical results in reference to the training, as well\nas individual performance of the participants, gave us feedback to use during the next training cycle. The\nuse of back office was easy after the support and help I had from the Conferience team. The support was\nexcellent and ready to provide solutions. I will definitely use Conferience again in the next training cycle or\nconference!\nAgathi Pafili\n-\nSenior Regulatory Policy Advisor\n,\nEuropean Fund and Asset Management Association (EFAMA)\nConferience is a great tool that allows a true interaction between speakers and audience in a fast, easy and efficient way. It allows the right questions to be put on the table and an exchange of views with as many of the participants wish to raise their voice. It therefore makes a conference more lively and interesting to everyone.\nSEN/JA\n-\nAlumni Greece\n,\nWe tested Conferience in one of our events and now we are trying to use it in every single one! It can\nturn a good experience into an amazing one by simply adding the parameter of interaction. More than 80%\nof the attendees used it and the result was amazing. Questions didn't seem to end, hearing even the shyest\nattendees' opinion and the results of the pols gave us important feedback for further actions. Undoubtedly\nit is going to become a must for every informal, social or business event organized in the future.\nMarianna  Kalendi\n-\nGeneral Secretariat\n,\nDigital Policy | Ministry of Digital Policy, Telecommunications & Media\nThe platform contributed significantly to the success of our event and the collection of the participants’ questions ran smoothly before as well as during the course of the event.\nChristiana Koudigkeli\n-\nLogistics Coordinator\n,\nJob Fair Athens 2015\nConferience definitely brought our event and our Q&A sessions to the next level. We used it to bring\ntogether our audience and the speakers in a more interactive and modern way. It was the second year in a\nrow that we decided to get involved with Conferience and the feedback we received from the users helped\nus reevaluate our agenda and gave us valuable ideas that we’ll try to implement next year. The platform is\nuser-friendly and innovating. We would strongly suggest it for similar panels and events.\nChristi Mousioni\n-\nSales Institute in Greece\n,\nOperations Manager\nConferience is an interactive and helpful event app for the participants and administrators. I would like to thank the Conferience team for the great support!\nVasileios Gongolidis\n-\nGeneral Secretariat for Research & Technology\n,\nMember of the organizing committee of the 2nd Technology Forum 2015\nThe web application Conferience made it easier for the moderators of the various sessions to interact with the audience through their smartphones and evaluate the speakers as well as the whole event. Additionally, the report we received after the conclusion of the event was very useful. The organizing committee considers using Conferience on a permanent basis for future events. The 2nd Technology Forum was co organized by the Association of Information Technology Companies of Northern Greece, Centre for Research and Technology-Hellas, Greek International Business Association, Federation of Industries of Northern Greece, Aristotle University, University of Macedonia, under the auspices of Alexander Innovation Zone, General Secretariat for Research & Technology and International Hellenic University. The purpose of the Forum was to promote new technologies as well as synergies between enterprises and academic/research institutions on the ICT sector.\nRenata Papadimitriou\n-\nManaging Director\n,\nThe PR Corp.\nConferience was chosen to be the element that will convert our client’s meeting to an open channel of communication among the presenter and the audience within the room and the one attending remotely! Goal achieved 100% providing optimum feedback!\nThanos Paraschos\n-\nFounder of Youth Entrepreneurship Club\n,\nCEO of iprovidenow Ltd\nWe used Conferience during Pan-European Startup Europe Week event 2016 in Chania-Crete, which was\nheld simultaneously in 40 countries and 200+ cities in Europe, and it was the first big -scale event to be\norganized by Youth Entrepreneurship Club as an ambassador! The pressure to achieve an organization of\nhigh quality was intense. Given the theme of our event, we chose Conferience as an example of a\nsuccessful Startup and we were not disappointed. On the contrary, Conferience confirmed its reputation\nand exceeded our expectations.Its usage was simple and easy, it contributed to the overall experience of\nour audience who were able to conveniently place questions and remarks without the stress of verbal\ncommunication or interrupting the flow of discussion. Through a democratic procedure, the best question\nwas voted to finally be addressed to the speakers, promoting the conversation. Conferience team was\n100% alert and supportive to provide any guidance we needed, and the platform responded excellently\nduring the discussion as well as during the evaluation of the event and the polls in the startup pitching\ncontest. In the end we were able to quickly receive poll results, analytic infographics, as well as exported\ndata and statistics, yielding valuable information about audience engagement and feedback. Conferience\nmajorly enhanced satisfaction and overall success of our event, impressing our audience and providing\nuseful tools to calculate variables of this success. It has been a problem solver. Using Conferience in the\nfuture for similar events, is recommended and for us, it is a given.\nTimo Lahnalampi\n-\nSenior Consultant\n,\nGiulia Pastor, Consultant\nWe found the Conferience tool very useful, especially for creating interactivity and asking questions in an event with a very tight timeline. The response from the audience was positive: a lot of questions were asked via the tool providing a good basis for the Q&A part of the session and creating a positive feedback for us\nPaul  Hourlias\n-\nMarketing & Tech Manager at Youth Entrepreneurship Club\n,\nAfter the successful Startup Europe Week, we organized in Chania, Crete last year, this year we decided\nto level up organizing it in Chania as well as in Heraklion and Rethymnon. Knowing that, especially in\nthese big-scale events,\nthere is a gap between the audience and the speakers, we decided to use the features of Conferience to\nbridge it. Having used Conferience last year we found out that all the features were renewed, and the new\ninterface was even more simplified. Apart from that, the questions feature was the highlight of them\nall, impressing all of the speakers along with the audience which was able to make anonymous questions\nwithout any hassle at all. The majority of the audience used it and the results were truly amazing. It gave\nthe event an extraordinary spark setting it apart from others. The questions feature also has the\ndemocratic option of liking questions, so the top ones can be answered first. Inasmuch as this year\nStartup Europe Week Crete 2017 was a chain of events throughout the week the event evaluation feature\nthat is provided through Conferience was certainly very helpful. At the end of the event we could take a\nlook at the responses the audience left and correct some potential mistakes for the next event. The same\nthing could be done with the event report that the Conferience team instantly sent us. The team was\nextremely helpful and responsive and could provide us with any information needed. Using Conferience in\nStartup Europe Week Crete 2017 was undoubtedly very helpful for us and is recommended for similar\nevents.\nFotis Fotopoulos\n-\nPresident of the Board of the Panhellenic Association of Translators\n,\nConferience provided us with the necessary tools to boost interaction between the speakers and the audience and meet the fundamental goals of our conference, which were true engagement and communication.\nSofia Cruickshank\n-\nBusiness Administrator\n,\nNext Level Information Ltd\nConferience allowed us to move away from a traditional printed event guide and enabled our attendees to\ninteract with speakers anonymously or not, participate in workshops & sessions, vote on polls, view the\nattendees’ list/agenda/speaker profiles/sponsor profiles and receive important announcements. The\nsupport leading up to and throughout the event was extremely responsive and professional, the team\nmade the impossible possible by creating new features within the app to fulfil our needs! Most\nimportantly, we were able to make amendments to any content from the back office seamlessly and our\nattendees found the app very user-friendly. We will definitely use Conferience for future events of the\nsame model.\nOlympia  Kokka\n-\nExecutive Director\n,\nYouth Entrepreneurship Club\nIt was the third year in a row that we used the Conferience during the Pan-European Conference Startup\nEurope Week Crete that was held in 4 different cities. Every year we are impressed with the features\nadded such as attendees networking, speakers’ evaluation and event evaluation which is a valuable\nfeedback. It's a great tool that engages the audience and upgrades the level of a conference. We will\ndefinitely use it in our next events.\nIoannis Nikolaou\n-\nAssociate Professor of Organizational Behaviour, Work & Organizational Psychologist\n,\nAthens University of Economics and Business\nConferience has been our main partner during the two recent Human Resource Management Conferences we organize every two years here at the Athens University of economics and Business. Conferience team has been really professional, very responsive, dealing effectively, accurately and efficiently with all our requests, even under very limited (if any at all) time. Conferience is a very good solution for any kind of meetings and conferences providing high quality services and solutions.\nFotis Psarros\n-\nAllergologist\n,\nSecretary General of 12th Panhellenic Congress of Allergy and Clinical Immunology\nWe decided to use the \"Conferience\" application during the 12th Panhellenic Congress of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, which was held at the Megaron, the Athens concert hall, from the 29th of March until the 1st of April 2018. The conventional medical conference was converted into an interactive, exciting, event due to the app. There was a keen interest in debate sessions and questions from the audience. On behalf of the Conference President, the Board of Directors of the Hellenic Society of Allergy and Clinical Immunology and all participants, I would like to express our genuine thanks to the \"Conferience\" team for their contribution to such a successful conference.\nNerina Komioti\n-\nDirector General\n,\nHellenic Advertisers, Association (SDE)\nConferience is a great platform for managing the Q&A session in a conference. It is very easy to use, both for the administrator and for the participants. During our workshop, it encouraged the participation of the audience both by giving them the opportunity to enter questions and to vote for the ones that they found most interesting. At the same time, it enabled us (the organizers) to capture all questions, manage them according to their relevance to the Workshop's topic and prioritize them, based on likes, thus, manage efficiently the timing of the Q&A session. Additionally, the ex post full question report we received was very useful. In our next conferences, we intend to make use of Conferience’s Event Evaluation feature, in order to get constructive feedback avoiding printed evaluation forms.\nKonstantinos Kallinteris\n-\nProject Curator of PharmACon (Pharmaceutical Athenian Congress)\n,\nConferience was the most pioneering application in our congress. First and foremost, Conferience provided participants the opportunity to submit their questions, assess speakers’ performance and be informed about our agenda and sponsors. In particular, this innovative web app enriched our congress and contributed to the immediate interaction between attendees and our team. In other words, it was conducive to the improvement of our plan during the event and it enhanced the development of our social network. The support was excellent and ready to provide solutions. All things considered, Conferience was tailored to our needs and we are going to use it again in the future\nAlexandra Lamprou\n-\nPresident of Greek Pharmaceutical Students’ Federation.\n,\nWe used Conferience in our two latest events. It is a very useful application because the questions ran smoothly during the course of the event. Most of the participants evaluated the speakers and voted the questions they wanted to be answered. The contribution of the platform was significant to the success  of our events.\nTrusted by / Our cl\ni\nents\nContact Us\nLet's get in touch!\nOnline Services\ninfo@conferience.com\nOnline Contact\n+30-210.6846329 (GR)\n+44 118 328 0124 (UK)\nOffice Address\n12 Bishop Street, Leicester LE1 6AF\nUnited Kingdom\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail Address\nSubject\nMessage\nYou are just\n1 step\naway from staying in touch with us.\nSend Now\nWhy buy Conferience?\nAll in one.

An event, where you couldn’t find the words to start a proper conversation and connect with others? Introducing yourself in the right way is key to making a good first impression; that’s what matters, because after all, first impressions are the most lasting. This is the first step to developing a circle of acquaintances, which can offer you new job opportunitis, along with interesting information about your field and also introduce you to people that can make you open new doors.\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n   Our world is not yet back to normal, while contact and communication with other participants is even harder in virtual events. For that reason, you need to be updated on the ways, in which these virtual events have been fully adapted to your need for interconnection, offering you the right tools to achieve it.\n   <br/>\n   Apart from the extra push that these tools offer you, here are some tips for an easier first step…\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n   <strong>\n    Prepare a “speech”.\n   </strong>\n   <br/>\n   Your first introduction should contain your full name, your company’s title or the field you aim for, as well as an important personality detail; a detail that should be able to make your new acquaintances remember you or have an interest in talking to you more. It could be something you admire, your job role or the reason you attended the event at the first place.\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n   <strong>\n    Use non-verbal communication\n   </strong>\n   <br/>\n   If you wish to make a great non-verbal first impression and make it clear that you want to greet someone, you need to get up straight to your feet, make eye contact, smile and initiate a handshake with your new acquaintance. You have to radiate certainty and confidence! You should enhance/dress up your speech with body language.\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n   <strong>\n    Be yourself!\n   </strong>\n   <br/>\n   No matter how many tips you follow or how much you have prepared for a meeting, nothing is more important and more awe-striking than being yourself! Confidence and a wide smile are the only “weapons” you need, if you want to start an interesting conversation.\n   <br/>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n   <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1529704193007-e8c78f0f46f9?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=750&amp;q=80\"/>\n   We all more or less remember those days, when 24 hours never seemed enough to fit your busy agenda, while even the tightest of schedules couldn’t put everything in order. And sometimes, even if that tight schedule was actually enough, it was blocked by certain psychological factors – procrastination it is! Obviously, none of what I’m describing sounds unreasonable or surreal. You know you’ve got a problem, once these days turn into routine, instead of being occasional unpleasant memories…\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n   The truth is, that the most important factor determining whether 24 hours are enough for you or not, is not so much your workload itself, but the way you manage and organize it. Under the mentality of “work smarter, not harder”, you will find down below some simple tips that can increase your efficiency, without leaving you exhausted.\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n   <strong>\n    Time Management\n   </strong>\n   <br/>\n   You need to know whether multitasking is actually helping you, or just wasting your time. Most of the time we dive into many things at once, hoping to save some time for the next task we have to complete. That way, however, we often end up wasting extra time working on multiple tasks, leaving them incomplete – at the best-case scenario - or chaotic – at the worst. One task at a time, with specific time limit is the safest way to carry through with our work, without setting our other responsibilities back.\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n   <strong>\n    Stop procrastinating\n   </strong>\n   <br/>\n   Procrastination, or “Acracy” (Akrasia) as it was called by Socrates and Aristotle, is basically our own refusal to comply, in practice, with what our logic commands us. Behavioral psychology interprets the phenomenon as the inability of our Present Self to empathize with our Future Self, which is the one setting all of our goals. There is a solution; It is called \"temptation bundling\". This strategy is all about allowing yourself to do some of your favorite things, only during the task you tend to postpone or after you’ve finished it. E.g. Buy your favorite ice cream only after you’ve finished the cover letter you had to prepare yesterday or do your pedicure while archiving the emails of the week.\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n   <strong>\n    To don’t list\n   </strong>\n   <br/>\n   We are all familiar with the “To do list”, and there’s no way you haven’t at some point made one your own. It is definitely a great solution to get organized and work passionately and full of optimism. However, many times, in our effort to improve our \"To do list\", we end up taking up useless hobbies and tasks that steal our time and energy from more important activities. Thus, the \"To don’t list\" focuses more on what would be best to avoid, in order to use your energy in a productive and creative way. The first bullet for a successful \"To don’t list\" is \"Pointless scrolling on social media\".\n   <br/>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n   <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1507099985932-87a4520ed1d5?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1350&amp;q=80\"/>\n   The pandemic turned everything upside down. Countries all over the world have been forced to adopt public healthpreventive measures. The influence in the workplace was also important. Due to this situation and the new measures that were imposed, most companies, having no other choice, implemented remote-work, in order to keep their employees healthy and safe.\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n   Working from home isn’t always easy. Many employees feel stressed and often lose their productivity.\n   <br/>\n   For this reason, listed below are some tips to ensure your employees productivity while working from home.\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n   <strong>\n    Communication is Everything\n   </strong>\n   <br/>\n   Communication between employees that work remotely, is important, especially during these difficult times. Whether you have daily calls or weekly group meetings, you should use video conferencing tools to keep in touch with your employee as if you were physically in the company.\n   <br/>\n   As employees continue to adjust to remote work, consider giving them flexible working hours or extended deadlines to reduce their stress levels. Encourage employees to come to you if they are having difficulties and make sure they know you are there to support them. Asking your employees to get in contact with youwill clearly help you motivate them while they are working from home.\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n   <strong>\n    Company Transparency\n   </strong>\n   <br/>\n   The pandemic’s impact had as a result the de-manning in companies. Because of this, many employees feel that nothing about their career path is certain. That is why it is important as a company to restore the faith of your employees to the future of the company. To help your employeesregain their trust, you should continue to uphold your company values ​​and be transparent with them.\n   <br/>\n   Present to the whole company data and graphs during meetings in order to show them where you stand at the present time and where to want to get. And make sure your company’s well performance is celebrated.Being honest with your employees and updating themconstantly will help restore their confidence and boost their motivation for the company.\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n   <strong>\n    Maintaining Communication between Employees\n   </strong>\n   <br/>\n   If your employees feel isolated while working from home, chances are their motivation and efficiency levels are constantly running low. Fortunately, technology allows you to help your employees stay connected, no matter where they are. From hosting virtual group meals and breaks to celebrating work anniversaries and birthdays, you can boost your employees’ morale by giving them opportunities to be motivated and interact with each other.\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n   <strong>\n    Prioritize the Employees’ Safety\n   </strong>\n   <br/>\n   As many companies start to re-open their offices, employers should make employee safety their top priority. From the distancingin offices to the disinfection of workplaces and the mandatory face masks, there are several precautions that companies must follow to keep their employees safe. Maintaining a safe work environment will ease the nerves of employees returning to the office so that they can focus on their work and therefore remain motivated and eager for work.\n   <br/>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n   <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://conferiencestorage.s3.amazonaws.com/customBanners/e9d4564070d63a95b1aee8fada3780aa6125013199135.png\"/>\n   Carnival season (Apokries) is close and it will be more different than ever!

People, the most vital element of all teams, have to work remotely, all the while keeping their enthusiasm alive.\n   <br/>\n   Especially during the holidays, all meetings, company celebrations and events were held in person. As we all remember, the team’s Christmas party was a meeting point for everyone and a chance to escape our busy routines…\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n   Now, however, most employees have to work remotely and everything that comes with their working routine is now taking place at home.\n   <br/>\n   At first, it may have seemed interesting, as it was something new to discover and adapt to as quickly as possible. During that first transitional period, everyone’s interest was maintained… but for how long?\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n   Employees are less and less interested in attending the online meetings, something they previously used to look forward to. The interaction between colleagues is now exclusively online and most of the time, the feeling of togetherness may have started to fade.\n   <br/>\n   It’s reasonable for the employers to run out of ideas to make remote work and company meetings more exciting. How can we cut this year’s Basil Pie (Vasilopita)?\n   <br/>\n   How can we celebrate the arrival of the new year online?\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n   Conferience makes 4 creative suggestions to help you keep your employees’ interest alive:\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n   <strong>\n    Organize out-of-company events\n   </strong>\n   <br/>\n   It’s pretty easy for employees to “get boggled” at their routine, especially now that they can’t communicate and interact with their colleagues, the way they used to while at the office. Organizing small, different online events every now and then (every two weeks, for instance) would be an interesting way to keep the team tight-knit.\n   <br/>\n   For instance, there could be quizzes with a small prize, so that participating sounds more appealing, or online meetings, where everyone can discuss about last year’s memories and new year’s resolutions. It’s best if such discussions are kept loose and fun, so that the employees don’t mistake them for yet another work meeting that they are obligated to attend to.\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n   <strong>\n    Send small care packages for the holidays\n   </strong>\n   <br/>\n   This year, Christmas will be different for everyone. Every year, companies used to organize Christmas parties and pie cutting (Kopi Pitas) to celebrate the New Year, something employees always look forward to. This year, however, none of that can happen, since everyone is at home and gatherings are not allowed. What can happen, though, is organizing an online party and also sending small care-packages to the employees, so that you can open them simultaneously at the Zoom meeting.\n   <br/>\n   The packages may consist of Christmas sweets, or even a piece of Basil Pie (Vasilopita) including, of course, the hidden coin, for the lucky one to find! Alternatively, you can organize a lottery with small gifts or a Christmas knowledge competition.\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n   This year, interaction is what everyone misses the most! Care-packages will bring joy to your team members, keeping their spirits high after the holiday season.\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n   <strong>\n    Encourage personal relationships\n   </strong>\n   <br/>\n   All employees are not only professionals, but also humans. They need to develop and maintain human contact with their colleagues and perhaps discuss about their house routine, their thoughts and concerns.\n   <br/>\n   Create an online communication environment, where your colleagues can feel free to share a part of their life with others. This way, a different form of human interaction and communication is achieved, so that employees don’t feel like 8-hour-straight-working robots, who don’t talk to anyone. Allow small breaks, so that they can rest and recharge their batteries.\n   <br/>\n   In this context, a virtual lunch break or a break for coffee could take place, as if we were at the office. That way, employees can discuss while eating their lunch together.\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n   <strong>\n    Reward\n   </strong>\n   <br/>\n   Recognition is the simplest way to motivate and raise the team’s confidence. Sometimes, concentrating and being productive and efficient while working at home is a pretty challenging task for team members. Therefore, it is very important to reward our colleagues, as well as the teams that met our goals, despite adversity. And once that happens, they all need to hear a “good job”, so that they keep on being efficient.\n   <br/>\n   Of course, it’d be even more helpful, if all employees participated in this recognition process, so that they can take it as an example and try to be more alert and aware of how important their contribution to the company is.\n   <br/>\n   In conclusion, everyone is going through a very difficult time; a time of adjustment that requires creativity, new ideas and innovation. Some small changes can help make our everyday life interesting, keeping the team’s spirits high!\n   <br/>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n   <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1588196749597-9ff075ee6b5b?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1267&amp;q=80\"/>\n   As we all know, COVID-19 has changed our world -as well as the world of events- dramatically! Until now, everything would happen in person, but suddenly, we have to adjust to a new, virtual reality. What does this mean? No more face-to-face events or hanging out with our beloved ones, our colleagues and our clients.\n   <br/>\n   Our new reality comes with online meetings, conferences, remote awards, as well as many video games! However, if we want to adjust to this new dimension of events, we have to take some basic steps first…\n   <br/>\n   So, what are the 5 easy steps for someone to enter that virtual world of events?\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n   <strong>\n    Organize it properly!\n   </strong>\n   <br/>\n   The first step for a successful event is getting to know your audience. You have to know who you’re addressing to, what works best for your audience and what they’d want to see from you. Your event should be adapted to your audience, for a greater impact.\n   <br/>\n   Once you’ve learned everything about your audience, all you have to do is choose your ideal event type. You can choose from a conference to an internal meeting, an award planning or even a live concert. Choose between a live video or a pre-recorded presentation. (Τip: live presentations are always more direct and preferable!)\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n   <strong>\n    Choose the platform that works best for you!\n   </strong>\n   <br/>\n   You can use different platforms, depending on the size or the type of the event. Not all available platforms are suitable for all events. Will it be local or global? Will it have integrated social media or not? Will it be able to host 10 or 1000 people? These are all questions that need to be answered before choosing the platform to use. Some of them are:\n   <br/>\n   -Zoom\n   <br/>\n   -Cisco Webex Events\n   <br/>\n   -Microsoft Teams\n   <br/>\n   -YouTube\n   <br/>\n   -Facebook\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n   <strong>\n    Make your event interactive!\n   </strong>\n   <br/>\n   Is there anything better for the participants than being able to interact with the speakers and with each other? Give your audience voice, by making your event more interactive, but also more…fun!\n   <br/>\n   Quizzes, Puzzles, Live Polls, Q&amp;As and much more that can make your event special and instantly make it more attractive for someone who wants to attend to it. These features will make your event stand out among the rest… which leads to the next step.\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n   <strong>\n    Promote it!\n   </strong>\n   <br/>\n   Why choose your event? What sets it apart from all the other similar ones? Find what makes your event unique and promote it properly. Use event sites and social media, so that it can be seen by as many people as possible. If you want your event to make an impact, promote it the right way, using the right tools. That way, people can know about your event, be attracted to it and choose it, over others.\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n   <strong>\n    All set!\n   </strong>\n   <br/>\n   If you follow all the above simple steps, then you’re almost set for your event. Now there are services, available for anything you need for virtual events, such as Zoom for videos and Kahoot for quizzes, among many others, depending on your needs and on the way you want to design your event.\n   <br/>\n   At the same time, if you want more features within a single application, Conferience offers all the features you might need for any kind of event. Video sharing using Zoom, Webex, Vimeo, your own streaming or Conferience video call, as well as simultaneous use of many interaction tools such as Agenda, Quiz, Live Voting, Media Wall and more.\n   <br/>\n   No stress and a good strategy are all you need for an unforgettable event… even if it’s way out of the ordinary!\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>",

An event, where you couldn’t find the words to start a proper conversation and connect with others? Introducing yourself in the right way is key to making a good first impression; that’s what matters, because after all, first impressions are the most lasting. This is the first step to developing a circle of acquaintances, which can offer you new job opportunitis, along with interesting information about your field and also introduce you to people that can make you open new doors.\nOur world is not yet back to normal, while contact and communication with other participants is even harder in virtual events. For that reason, you need to be updated on the ways, in which these virtual events have been fully adapted to your need for interconnection, offering you the right tools to achieve it.\nApart from the extra push that these tools offer you, here are some tips for an easier first step…\nPrepare a “speech”.\nYour first introduction should contain your full name, your company’s title or the field you aim for, as well as an important personality detail; a detail that should be able to make your new acquaintances remember you or have an interest in talking to you more. It could be something you admire, your job role or the reason you attended the event at the first place.\nUse non-verbal communication\nIf you wish to make a great non-verbal first impression and make it clear that you want to greet someone, you need to get up straight to your feet, make eye contact, smile and initiate a handshake with your new acquaintance. You have to radiate certainty and confidence! You should enhance/dress up your speech with body language.\nBe yourself!\nNo matter how many tips you follow or how much you have prepared for a meeting, nothing is more important and more awe-striking than being yourself! Confidence and a wide smile are the only “weapons” you need, if you want to start an interesting conversation.\nWe all more or less remember those days, when 24 hours never seemed enough to fit your busy agenda, while even the tightest of schedules couldn’t put everything in order. And sometimes, even if that tight schedule was actually enough, it was blocked by certain psychological factors – procrastination it is! Obviously, none of what I’m describing sounds unreasonable or surreal. You know you’ve got a problem, once these days turn into routine, instead of being occasional unpleasant memories…\nThe truth is, that the most important factor determining whether 24 hours are enough for you or not, is not so much your workload itself, but the way you manage and organize it. Under the mentality of “work smarter, not harder”, you will find down below some simple tips that can increase your efficiency, without leaving you exhausted.\nTime Management\nYou need to know whether multitasking is actually helping you, or just wasting your time. Most of the time we dive into many things at once, hoping to save some time for the next task we have to complete. That way, however, we often end up wasting extra time working on multiple tasks, leaving them incomplete – at the best-case scenario - or chaotic – at the worst. One task at a time, with specific time limit is the safest way to carry through with our work, without setting our other responsibilities back.\nStop procrastinating\nProcrastination, or “Acracy” (Akrasia) as it was called by Socrates and Aristotle, is basically our own refusal to comply, in practice, with what our logic commands us. Behavioral psychology interprets the phenomenon as the inability of our Present Self to empathize with our Future Self, which is the one setting all of our goals. There is a solution; It is called \"temptation bundling\". This strategy is all about allowing yourself to do some of your favorite things, only during the task you tend to postpone or after you’ve finished it. E.g. Buy your favorite ice cream only after you’ve finished the cover letter you had to prepare yesterday or do your pedicure while archiving the emails of the week.\nTo don’t list\nWe are all familiar with the “To do list”, and there’s no way you haven’t at some point made one your own. It is definitely a great solution to get organized and work passionately and full of optimism. However, many times, in our effort to improve our \"To do list\", we end up taking up useless hobbies and tasks that steal our time and energy from more important activities. Thus, the \"To don’t list\" focuses more on what would be best to avoid, in order to use your energy in a productive and creative way. The first bullet for a successful \"To don’t list\" is \"Pointless scrolling on social media\".\nThe pandemic turned everything upside down. Countries all over the world have been forced to adopt public healthpreventive measures. The influence in the workplace was also important. Due to this situation and the new measures that were imposed, most companies, having no other choice, implemented remote-work, in order to keep their employees healthy and safe.\nWorking from home isn’t always easy. Many employees feel stressed and often lose their productivity.\nFor this reason, listed below are some tips to ensure your employees productivity while working from home.\nCommunication is Everything\nCommunication between employees that work remotely, is important, especially during these difficult times. Whether you have daily calls or weekly group meetings, you should use video conferencing tools to keep in touch with your employee as if you were physically in the company.\nAs employees continue to adjust to remote work, consider giving them flexible working hours or extended deadlines to reduce their stress levels. Encourage employees to come to you if they are having difficulties and make sure they know you are there to support them. Asking your employees to get in contact with youwill clearly help you motivate them while they are working from home.\nCompany Transparency\nThe pandemic’s impact had as a result the de-manning in companies. Because of this, many employees feel that nothing about their career path is certain. That is why it is important as a company to restore the faith of your employees to the future of the company. To help your employeesregain their trust, you should continue to uphold your company values ​​and be transparent with them.\nPresent to the whole company data and graphs during meetings in order to show them where you stand at the present time and where to want to get. And make sure your company’s well performance is celebrated.Being honest with your employees and updating themconstantly will help restore their confidence and boost their motivation for the company.\nMaintaining Communication between Employees\nIf your employees feel isolated while working from home, chances are their motivation and efficiency levels are constantly running low. Fortunately, technology allows you to help your employees stay connected, no matter where they are. From hosting virtual group meals and breaks to celebrating work anniversaries and birthdays, you can boost your employees’ morale by giving them opportunities to be motivated and interact with each other.\nPrioritize the Employees’ Safety\nAs many companies start to re-open their offices, employers should make employee safety their top priority. From the distancingin offices to the disinfection of workplaces and the mandatory face masks, there are several precautions that companies must follow to keep their employees safe. Maintaining a safe work environment will ease the nerves of employees returning to the office so that they can focus on their work and therefore remain motivated and eager for work.\nCarnival season (Apokries) is close and it will be more different than ever! This year, throwing a costume party at the office, dressing up and celebrating with our loved ones is not an option. This Carnival will have nothing in common with the previous ones.\nThe Conferience team has made sure to offer you unique, memorable moments through the Share Your Moment feature!\nDress up with your favorite costumes, fill the space with confetti and post a photo on our Media Wall.

It helps them design a better and more effective operating plan, fix any of their weaknesses and develop a more customer-friendly strategy.\nThe Conferience platform offers you the chance to design your own questionnaire, in order to collect data from the participants after an event or a competition you may have organized, as well as evaluations among colleagues regarding the operation of the company.\nApart from designing your own customized questionnaire, you can choose from a variety of already set questionnaires applying to over 10 different fields and sectors, if you want to save time.

We invite you to access our website and use the Conferience Services, but please note that the usage of the site’s services is subject to your review and agreement with these Terms of Use. These Terms of Use describe in detail your rights as well as ours regarding the Use of Conferience, so please review these terms carefully.\nINTRODUCTION\nConferience Ltd\n. (“Conferience”, “we” or “us”) provides an event management solution to help Event Organizers or Organizers (“Clients”) provide various tools and solutions (\"Services\"), through a cloud-based platform (“Platform”), that enable real-time active engagement of Participants/App Users (“Users”) at any kind of event, either physically or virtually.\n“You” refers to both Event Organizers and Users, unless specified otherwise.\nWho is Subject to These Terms\nThese Terms apply to your use of the Services when you access the Services as a Client or as an App User. By ordering or using the Services, you expressly acknowledge and agree that you are entering into a legal agreement with Conferience and have understood and agreed to comply with and be legally bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement (“Services Agreement”).\nOur clients (“Clients”) make some of these Services available to their Participants/App Users (“Users”) for use in connection with one or more events.\nPermission of Usage\nYou represent and warrant that you are of legal age and legally competent to enter into this Agreement in your jurisdiction. If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of an entity, you further represent that you are authorized to enter into this Agreement on behalf of said entity. You hereby grant us permission to publicly display your profile on the event app, when using the networking feature, Your content and any such information that may be supplied by you and designated for public display on the Networking Attendees service or any other customized service that you give your consent for it to be displayed on and presented publicly.\nSubject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, we hereby grant you a personal, revocable, non-exclusive, non-licensable, non-assignable, non-transferable right and permission to use the Service for events that you organize or manage.\nACCESS\nUpon acceptance of this Agreement, Conferience will provide the Client with login access to the Content Management System. The Client is solely responsible for their actions while using Conferience, the password needed in order to access the Content Management System and the actions of their Users, such as attendees, clients, employees and agents that use the Conferience on the Clients’ behalf.\nAccess to the event is provided to Users via an event id given by Event Organizers. Access is easy using any device, such as smart phone, tablet, pc or laptop, either by using a browser or by downloading a native app from the Google Play store or the Apple store. The app could be the Conferience app or any branded app created by Conferience.\nIt is solely on the Event Organizer’s and User's responsibility to keep the event id private and not publish it through any medium (electronic or other), unless the Event Organizer grants permission fot it to be published by any User at the event or in any other public electronic or physical place.\nEvent Organizer Password\nThe Event Organizer is solely responsible for keeping the password confidential. The Organizer may not use the account, username, or password of another Conferience Organizer, and agrees to immediately notify Conferience of any unauthorized use of the account, username or password. We assume no responsibility and will not be liable for any loss that may occur as a result of someone else using your password, either with or without your knowledge.\nAnonymous or Identified Access\n- No login process: Users are anonymous in any of the services and features provided by Conferience. Unless Users are asked to type their names on any feature, such as Questions, Voting, Ideas, Event or Speakers’ Evaluation, on the web app, native app of Conferience, Branded web app or native app created or powered by Conferience, there is no way for them to be identified.\n- Login process: Participants may use Conferience through a Login and/or Registration process. In this process, Users are identified in all sections, services, and features of Conferience, as Users provide their email, name, password, organization, telephone numbers and other personal data.\nAdaptation rights\nThe Organizer and Participants expressly authorize Conferience, for as long as their profile or content exists, to produce overviews of the event in which they have participated, and to compile documents, photographs, and videos shown during the event as well as participants' comments and images of speakers in a specific format or file. This overview will be distributed only to Participants of the event when the Organizer has indicated that it is permitted only for the Participants of the event, or it will be freely accessible to the public when the Organizer has indicated that it is permitted for it to be made public, even on social media.\nThe User, likewise, declares to have accepted the above terms and, when the event is public, the Participants and the Organizer of this event have the ability to share and broadcast, for free and for non-commercial ends, some or all of the content the User has published on Conferience services or any other secondary internet services, such as social or professional networks (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn). In no case will Conferience be held responsible for the sharing or broadcasting of this content, which is entirely on the User's initiative and their sole responsibility.\nThe User promises, finally and definitely, not to seek reimbursement of any kind from Conferience or its beneficiaries in relation to the exertion of these intellectual property rights under the conditions laid out in these Terms.\nIf the User notices any illegal content, abuse or violation of third party rights, they notify Conferience by sending an email to the address\ninfo@conferience.com\n. Any reports based knowingly on false information give rise to liability on the part of the user.\nCOOKIES\nWe use cookies to provide the best experience through our services.\nWhat is a cookie?\nA cookie is a small data file that is sent to your browser from our servers and stored on your computer's hard disk and smart devices.

However, Conferience works excellent on the latest editions of the main browsers, such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, Microsoft Explorer and it may make any effort to fix issues on old browsers for a better experience.\nAny potential charges relating to the access, either via telecom providers and their networks, such as 3G, 4G or via any Wi-Fi, is the Clients' or Participants' responsibility.\nFurthermore, an Event Organizer or Participant, must possess all necessary hardware required to access the internet or mobile network. The costs of acquisition of any required hardware are exclusively the Event Organizer or Participant’s responsibility.\nCREATION AND DELETION OF EVENT ORGANIZER’S ACCOUNT\nCreation of Account\nEvent Organizers can create an account on the official website of Conferience. When you decide to create an account, you automatically agree to our Terms of Service. All data that will be collected from said account will remain in Conferience's cloud for as long as the Organizer wishes and chooses to keep the account active.\nDeletion of Account\nEvent Organizers can delete their account anytime they wish from the Content Management System, and more specifically from their account settings. For security purposes and to avoid any misunderstanding, when you delete your account, you need to confirm the deletion of the account via a confirmation email to the owner of the account.

You acknowledge and agree that we make no representations or warranties about, and do not endorse, any third party products, services or the information provided by third parties, whether through the Services or otherwise.

Nepanda works under an identification process via a Linkedin, Facebook or Nepanda account.

For more information about the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy of Nepanda, please visit their site.\nBETA SERVICE AND FEATURES\nConferience sometimes launches new or redesigned parts of the Service that need some time to be tested and improved before they are offered as the “real deal” (\"Beta Service\"). The BETA label is displayed on such new Services to prove that it has been tested - it may not work for everyone. Most BETA Services are free, but some may need payment.\nUse of the Beta Service is subject to these Terms and any additional terms that Conferience may, in Conferience’s sole discretion, specify from time to time.\nUse of the Beta Service is only permitted for the period designated by Conferience. Conferience may terminate the Customer’s right to use the Beta Service at any time and for any reason in Conferience's sole discretion, without any liability to the Customer.\nCustomer understands that any pre-releases and Beta Services are still under development, and therefore, may be inoperable or incomplete and are likely to contain more errors and bugs than generally available products.\nConferience makes no promises that any Beta Service will ever be made generally available.\nExcept as otherwise provided in these Terms and the Security Standards, Conferience is providing any Beta Service to Customer “as is.” Conferience makes no warranties of any kind, with respect to Beta Services, whether expressed, implied, statutory or otherwise. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Conferience disclaims all obligations or liabilities with respect to Beta Services, including but not limited to, any support and maintenance, warranty, and indemnity obligations.\nYou do not have to use the Beta Services if you do not wish to.\nCHAT\nThe feature may permit you to send messages (including via email) to other users (“Chat”).

You agree to hold us and your Event Organizer harmless, and expressly release us, from any and all liability arising from your messages. You grant us a worldwide license to use, store and reproduce your Messages, for the limited purpose of facilitating sending them to your designated recipients (we may also use the toolsand services of third party service providers to facilitate the sending of Messages to your designated recipients). You represent and warrant that you own or have the necessary rights and permissions to use all of the Intellectual Property Rights in and to your Messages, and to grant the foregoing license to us. You retain all ownership rights to your Messages.\nUSER SUBMISSIONS\nThe Service may permit the posting, hosting, sharing and publishing of content, such as text, video link, pictures and common digital materials in any format by you and other users (“User Submissions\").
